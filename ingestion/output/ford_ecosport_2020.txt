Introduction
Your vehicle has electronic control units
that have data recording functionality and
the ability to permanently or temporarily
store data. This data could include
information on the condition and status of
your vehicle, vehicle maintenance
requirements, events and malfunctions.
The types of data that can be recorded are
described in this section. Some of the data
recorded is stored in event logs or error
logs.
Note: Error logs are reset following a service
or repair.
Note: We may provide information in
response to requests from law enforcement,
other government authorities and third
parties acting with lawful authority or
through a legal process. Such information
could be used by them in legal proceedings.
Data recorded includes, for example:
•
Operating states of system
components, for example fuel level,
tire pressure and battery charge level.
•
Vehicle and component status, for
example wheel speed, deceleration,
lateral acceleration and seatbelt
status.
•
Events or errors in essential systems,
for example headlamps and brakes.
•
System responses to driving situations,
for example airbag deployment and
stability control.
•
Environmental conditions, for example
temperature.
Some of this data, when used in
combination with other information, for
example an accident report, damage to a
vehicle or eyewitness statements, could
be associated with a specific person.
Service Data
Service data recorders in your vehicle are
capable of collecting and storing
diagnostic information about your vehicle.
This potentially includes information about
the performance or status of various
systems and modules in the vehicle, such
as engine, throttle, steering or brake
systems. In order to properly diagnose and
service your vehicle, Ford Motor Company
(Ford of Canada in Canada), and service
and repair facilities may access or share
among them vehicle diagnostic
information received through a direct
connection to your vehicle when
diagnosing or servicing your vehicle.
Additionally, Ford Motor Company (Ford
of Canada, in Canada) may, where
permitted by law, use vehicle diagnostic
information for vehicle improvement or
with other information we may have about
you, (for example, your contact
information), to offer you products or
services that may interest you. Data may
be provided to our service providers such
as part suppliers that may help diagnose
malfunctions, and who are similarly
obligated to protect data. We retain this
data only as long as necessary to perform
these functions or to comply with law. We
may provide information where required
in response to official requests to law
enforcement or other government
authorities or third parties acting with
lawful authority or court order, and such
information may be used in legal
proceedings. For U.S. only (if equipped), if
you choose to use connected apps and
services, you consent that certain
diagnostic information may also be
accessed electronically by Ford Motor
Company and Ford authorized service
facilities, and that the diagnostic
information may be used to provide
services to you, personalizing your
experience, troubleshoot, and to improve
products and services and offer you

Introduction
products and services that may interest
you, where permitted by law. For Canada
only, for more information, please review
the Ford of Canada privacy policy at
www.ford.ca, including our U.S. data
storage and use of service providers in
other jurisdictions who may be subject to
legal requirements in Canada, the United
States and other countries applicable to
them, for example, lawful requirements to
disclose personal information to
governmental authorities in those
countries.
Event Data
This vehicle is equipped with an event data
recorder. The main purpose of an event
data recorder is to record, in certain crash
or near crash-like situations, such as an
airbag deployment or hitting a road
obstacle; this data will assist in
understanding how a vehicle’s systems
performed. The event data recorder is
designed to record data related to vehicle
dynamics and safety systems for a short
period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The event data recorder in this vehicle is
designed to record such data as:
•
How various systems in your vehicle
were operating;
•
Whether or not the driver and
passenger seatbelts were
buckled/fastened;
•
How far (if at all) the driver was
depressing the accelerator and/or the
brake pedal; and
•
How fast the vehicle was traveling; and
•
Where the driver was positioning the
steering wheel.
This data can help provide a better
understanding of the circumstances in
which crashes and injuries occur.
Note: Event data recorder data is recorded
by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash
situation occurs; no data is recorded by the
event data recorder under normal driving
conditions and no personal data or
information (e.g., name, gender, age, and
crash location) is recorded. However,
parties, such as law enforcement, could
combine the event data recorder data with
the type of personally identifying data
routinely acquired during a crash
investigation.
To read data recorded by an event data
recorder, special equipment is required,
and access to the vehicle or the event data
recorder is needed. In addition to the
vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such
as law enforcement, that have such special
equipment, can read the information if they
have access to the vehicle or the event
data recorder.
Comfort, Convenience and
Entertainment Data
Your vehicle has electronic control units
that have the ability to store data based
on your personalized settings. The data is
stored locally in the vehicle or on devices
that you connect to it, for example, a USB
drive or digital music player. You can delete
some of this data and also choose whether
to share it through the services to which
you subscribe.  See Settings (page 355).
Comfort and Convenience Data
Data recorded includes, for example:
•
Seat and steering wheel position.
•
Climate control settings.
•
Radio presets.

Introduction
Entertainment Data
Data recorded includes, for example:
•
Music, videos or album art.
•
Contacts and corresponding address
book entries.
•
Navigation destinations.
Services That We Provide
If you use our services, we collect and use
data, for example account information,
vehicle location and driving characteristics,
that could identify you. We transmit this
data through a dedicated, protected
connection. We only collect and use data
to enable your use of our services to which
you have subscribed, with your consent or
where permitted by law. For additional
information, see the terms and conditions
of the services to which you have
subscribed.
Services That Third Parties
Provide
We recommend that you review the terms
and conditions and data privacy
information for any services to which you
subscribe. We take no responsibility for
services that third parties provide.
Vehicles With a Modem
The modem has a SIM. The modem
periodically sends messages to stay
connected to the cell phone network.
These messages could include information
that identifies your vehicle, the SIM and the
electronic serial number of the modem.
Cell phone network service providers could
have access to additional information, for
example cell phone network tower
identification.
Note: The modem continues to send this
information unless you have all added value
services deactivated. Contact the Ford
Customer Relationship Center. Refer to the
regional Ford website for contact
information.
Note: The service can be unavailable or
interrupted for a number of reasons, for
example environmental or topographical
conditions and data plan coverage.
Vehicles With SYNC
Mobile Device Data
If you connect a mobile device to your
vehicle, you can display data from your
device on the touchscreen for example,
music and album art. You can share your
vehicle data with mobile apps on your
device through the system.  See Apps
(page 353).
The mobile apps function operates by your
connected device sending data to us in the
United States. The data is encrypted and
includes the vehicle identification number
of your vehicle, the SYNC module serial
number, odometer, enabled apps, usage
statistics and debugging information. We
retain it only as long as necessary to
provide the service, to troubleshoot, for
continuous improvement and to offer you
products and services that may be of
interest to you according to your
preferences and where allowed by law.
If you connect a cell phone to the system,
the system creates a profile that links to
that cell phone. The cell phone profile
enables more mobile features and efficient
operation. The profile contains, for
example data from your phonebook, read
and unread text messages and call history,
including history of calls when your cell
phone was not connected to the system.

Introduction
If you connect a media device, the system
creates and retains a media device index
of supported media content. The system
also records a short diagnostic log of
approximately 10 minutes of all recent
system activity.
The cell phone profile, media device index
and diagnostic log remain in your vehicle
unless you delete them and are generally
accessible only in your vehicle when you
connect your cell phone or media device.
If you no longer plan to use the system or
your vehicle, we recommend you use the
master reset function to erase the stored
information.  See Settings (page 355).
System data cannot be accessed without
special equipment and access to your
vehicle's module.
For additional information about our
privacy policy, see the regional Ford
website.
Emergency Call System (If Equipped)
When you switch on the emergency call
system, it may disclose to emergency
services that your vehicle has been in a
crash involving the deployment of an
airbag or activation of the fuel pump
shut-off. Certain versions or updates to the
emergency call system may also be
capable of electronically or verbally
disclosing to emergency services operators
your vehicle location or other details about
your vehicle or crash to assist emergency
services operators to provide the most
appropriate emergency services. If you do
not want to disclose this information, do
not switch the feature on.
PERCHLORATE
Certain components in your vehicle such
as airbag modules, seatbelt pretensioners
and remote control batteries may contain
perchlorate material.  Special handling
may apply for service or vehicle end of life
disposal.

GENERAL INFORMATION
See the following sections for directions
on how to properly use safety restraints
for children.
WARNING: Always make sure your
child is secured properly in a device that
is appropriate for their height, age and
weight. Child safety restraints must be
bought separately from your vehicle.
Failure to follow these instructions and
guidelines may result in an increased risk
of serious injury or death to your child.
WARNING: All children are shaped
differently. The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration and other safety
organizations, base their
recommendations for child restraints on
probable child height, age and weight
thresholds, or on the minimum
requirements of the law. We recommend
that you check with a NHTSA Certified
Child Passenger Safety Technician
(CPST) to make sure that you properly
install the child restraint in your vehicle
and that you consult your pediatrician to
make sure you have a child restraint
appropriate for your child. To locate a
child restraint fitting station and CPST,
contact NHTSA toll free at
1-888-327-4236 or go to
www.nhtsa.dot.gov. In Canada, contact
Transport Canada toll free at
1-800-333-0371 or go to www.tc.gc.ca
to find a Child Car Seat Clinic in your
area. Failure to properly restrain children
in child restraints made especially for
their height, age and weight, may result
in an increased risk of serious injury or
death to your child.
WARNING: On hot days, the
temperature inside the vehicle can rise
very quickly. Exposure of people or
animals to these high temperatures for
even a short time can cause death or
serious heat related injuries, including
brain damage. Small children are
particularly at risk.

Child Safety
Recommendations for Safety Restraints for Children
Recommended Restraint
Type
Child Size, Height, Weight, or Age
Child
Use a child restraint
(sometimes called an
infant carrier, convertible
seat, or toddler seat).
Children weighing 40 lb (18 kg) or less
(generally age four or younger).
Infants or
toddlers
Use a belt-positioning
booster seat.
Children who have outgrown or no longer
properly fit in a child restraint (generally
children who are less than 57 in (1.45 m)
tall, are greater than age four and less
than age 12, and between 40 lb (18 kg)
and 80 lb (36 kg) and upward to 100 lb
(45 kg) if recommended by your child
restraint manufacturer).
Small children
Use a vehicle seatbelt
having the lap belt snug
and low across the hips,
shoulder belt centered
across the shoulder and
chest, and seat backrest
upright.
Children who have outgrown or no longer
properly fit in a belt-positioning booster
seat (generally children who are at least
57 in (1.45 m) tall or greater than 80 lb
(36 kg) or 100 lb (45 kg) if recommended
by child restraint manufacturer).
Larger children
•
You are required by law to properly use
child restraints for infants and toddlers
in the United States and Canada.
•
Many states and provinces require that
small children use approved booster
seats until they reach age eight, a
height of 57 in (1.45 m) tall, or 80 lb
(36 kg). Check your local and state or
provincial laws for specific
requirements about the safety of
children in your vehicle.
•
When possible, properly restrain
children 12 years of age and under in a
rear seating position of your vehicle.
Accident statistics suggest that
children are safer when properly
restrained in the rear seating positions
than in a front seating position.  See
General Information (page 18).
•
When installing a rear facing child
restraint, adjust the vehicle seats to
avoid interference between the child
restraint and the vehicle seat in front
of the child restraint.

INSTALLING CHILD
RESTRAINTS
Child Seats
Use a child safety seat (sometimes called
an infant carrier, convertible seat, or
toddler seat) for infants, toddlers, or
children weighing 40 lb (18 kg) or less
(generally age four or younger).
Using Lap and Shoulder Belts
WARNING: Airbags can kill or
injure a child in a child restraint. Never
place a rear-facing child restraint in front
of an active airbag. If you must use a
forward-facing child restraint in the front
seat, move the seat upon which the child
restraint is installed all the way back.
WARNING: Airbags can kill or
injure a child in a child restraint. Properly
restrain children 12 and under in the rear
seat whenever possible.
WARNING: Depending on where
you secure a child restraint, and
depending on the child restraint design,
you may block access to certain seatbelt
buckle assemblies and LATCH lower
anchors, rendering those features
potentially unusable. To avoid risk of
injury, make sure occupants only use
seating positions where they are able to
be properly restrained.
When installing a child safety seat with
combination lap and shoulder belts:
•
Use the correct safety belt buckle for
that seating position.
•
Insert the belt tongue into the proper
buckle until you hear a snap and feel it
latch. Make sure the tongue is securely
fastened in the buckle.
•
Keep the buckle release button
pointing up and away from the safety
seat, with the tongue between the child
seat and the release button, to prevent
accidental unbuckling.
•
Place the vehicle seat upon which the
child seat will be installed in the upright
position.
•
Put the safety belt in the automatic
locking mode. See Step 5. This vehicle
does not require the use of a locking
clip.
Perform the following steps when
installing the child seat with combination
lap and shoulder belts:
Note: Although the child seat illustrated is
a forward facing child seat, the steps are
the same for installing a rear facing child
seat.

Child Safety
Standard safety belts
1.
Position the child safety seat in a seat
with a combination lap and shoulder
belt.
2.
After positioning the child safety seat
in the proper seating position, pull
down on the shoulder belt and then
grasp the shoulder belt and lap belt
together behind the belt tongue.
3.
While holding the shoulder and lap belt
portions together, route the tongue
through the child seat according to the
child seat manufacturer's instructions.
Be sure the belt webbing is not twisted.
4.
Insert the belt tongue into the proper
buckle (the buckle closest to the
direction the tongue is coming from)
for that seating position until you hear
a snap and feel the latch engage. Make
sure the tongue is latched securely by
pulling on it.

Child Safety
5.
To put the retractor in the automatic
locking mode, grasp the shoulder
portion of the belt and pull downward
until all of the belt is pulled out.
Note: The automatic locking mode is
available on the front passenger and rear
seats.
6.
Allow the belt to retract to remove
slack. The belt will click as it retracts
to indicate it is in the automatic locking
mode.
7.
Try to pull the belt out of the retractor
to make sure the retractor is in the
automatic locking mode (you should
not be able to pull more belt out). If the
retractor is not locked, unbuckle the
belt and repeat Steps 5 and 6.
8.
Remove remaining slack from the belt.
Force the seat down with extra weight,
for example, by pressing down or
kneeling on the child restraint while
pulling up on the shoulder belt in order
to force slack from the belt. This is
necessary to remove the remaining
slack that will exist once the extra
weight of the child is added to the child
restraint. It also helps to achieve the
proper snugness of the child seat to
your vehicle. Sometimes, a slight lean
toward the buckle will provide extra
help to remove remaining slack from
the belt.
9.
Attach the tether strap (if the child seat
is equipped).
10.
Before placing the child in the seat,
forcibly move the seat forward and
back to make sure the seat is securely
held in place. To check this, grab the
seat at the belt path and attempt to
move it side to side and forward and
back. There should be no more than
1 in (2.5 cm) of movement for proper
installation.
We recommend checking with a NHTSA
Certified Child Passenger Safety
Technician to make certain the child
restraint is properly installed. In Canada,
check with Transport Canada for referral
to a Child Car Seat Clinic.

Child Safety
Using Lower Anchors and Tethers
for CHildren (LATCH)
WARNING: Do not attach two
child safety restraints to the same
anchor. In a crash, one anchor may not
be strong enough to hold two child
safety restraint attachments and may
break, causing serious injury or death.
WARNING: Depending on where
you secure a child restraint, and
depending on the child restraint design,
you may block access to certain seatbelt
buckle assemblies and LATCH lower
anchors, rendering those features
potentially unusable. To avoid risk of
injury, make sure occupants only use
seating positions where they are able to
be properly restrained.
The LATCH system is composed of three
vehicle anchor points: two lower anchors
located where seat back and seat cushion
meet (called the seat bight) and one top
tether anchor located behind that seating
position.
LATCH compatible child safety seats have
two rigid or webbing mounted
attachments that connect to the two lower
anchors at the LATCH equipped seating
positions in your vehicle. This type of
attachment method eliminates the need
to use safety belts to attach the child seat,
however the safety belt can still be used
to attach the child seat. For forward-facing
child seats, the top tether strap must also
be attached to the proper top tether
anchor, if a top tether strap has been
provided with your child seat.
Your vehicle has LATCH lower anchors for
child seat installation at the seating
positions marked with the child seat
symbol.
The LATCH anchors are located at the rear
section of the rear seat between the
cushion and seat back below the symbols
as shown. Follow the child seat
manufacturer's instructions to properly
install a child seat with LATCH
attachments. Follow the instructions on
attaching child safety seats with tether
straps.
Attach LATCH lower attachments of the
child seat only to the anchors shown.

EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Child Safety
Use of Inboard Lower Anchors from the
Outboard Seating Positions (Center
Seating Use)
WARNING: The standardized
spacing for LATCH lower anchors is 11 in
(280 mm) center to center. Do not use
LATCH lower anchors for the center
seating position unless the child restraint
manufacturer's instructions permit and
specify using anchors spaced at least as
far apart as those in this vehicle.
The lower anchors at the center of the
second row rear seat are spaced 15.75 in
(40 cm) apart. A child seat with rigid
LATCH attachments cannot be installed
at the center seating position. LATCH
compatible child seats (with attachments
on belt webbing) can only be used at this
seating position provided that the child
seat manufacturer's instructions permit
use with the anchor spacing stated. Do not
attach a child seat to any lower anchor if
an adjacent child seat is attached to that
anchor.
Each time you use the safety seat, check
that the seat is properly attached to the
lower anchors and tether anchor, if
applicable. Tug the child seat from side to
side and forward and back where it is
secured to your vehicle. The seat should
move less than one inch when you do this
for a proper installation.
If the safety seat is not anchored properly,
the risk of a child being injured in a crash
greatly increases.
Combining Safety Belt and LATCH
Lower Anchors for Attaching Child
Safety Seats
When used in combination, either the
safety belt or the LATCH lower anchors
may be attached first, provided a proper
installation is achieved. Attach the tether
strap afterward, if included with the child
seat.
Using Tether Straps
Many forward-facing child safety
seats include a tether strap
which extends from the back of
the child safety seat and hooks to an
anchoring point called the top tether
anchor. Tether straps are available as an
accessory for many older safety seats.
Contact the manufacturer of your child
seat for information about ordering a
tether strap, or to obtain a longer tether
strap if the tether strap on your safety seat
does not reach the appropriate top tether
anchor in your vehicle.
Once the child safety seat has been
installed using either the safety belt, the
lower anchors of the LATCH system, or
both, you can attach the top tether strap.
The tether strap anchors in your vehicle
are in the following positions (shown from
top view):
24
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Child Safety
Perform the following steps to install a
child safety seat with tether anchors:
Note: If you install a child seat with rigid
LATCH attachments, do not tighten the
tether strap enough to lift the child seat off
your vehicle seat cushion when the child is
seated in it. Keep the tether strap just snug
without lifting the front of the child seat.
Keeping the child seat just touching your
vehicle seat gives the best protection in a
severe crash.
1.
Route the child safety seat tether strap
over the back of the seat. For outboard
seating positions, route the tether strap
under the head restraint and between
the head restraint posts. For the center
seating positions, route the tether strap
over the top of the head restraint. If
needed, the head restraints can also
be removed.
2.
Locate the correct anchor for the
selected seating position.
3.
Clip the tether strap to the anchor as
shown.
4.
Tighten the child safety seat tether
strap according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
If your child restraint system is equipped
with a tether strap, and the child restraint
manufacturer recommends its use, Ford
also recommends its use.
BOOSTER SEATS
WARNING: Do not put the
shoulder section of the seatbelt or allow
the child to put the shoulder section of
the seatbelt under their arm or behind
their back. Failure to follow this
instruction could reduce the
effectiveness of the seatbelt and
increase the risk of injury or death in a
crash.
Use a belt-positioning booster seat for
children who have outgrown or no longer
properly fit in a child safety restraint
(generally children who are less than 57 in
(1.45 m) tall, are greater than age 4 and
less than age 12, and between 40 lb (18 kg)
and 80 lb (36 kg) and upward to 100 lb
25

Child Safety
(45 kg) if recommended by your child
restraint manufacturer). Many state and
provincial laws require that children use
approved booster seats until they reach
age eight, a height of 57 in (1.45 m) tall, or
80 lb (36 kg).
Booster seats should be used until you can
answer YES to ALL of these questions
when seated without a booster seat:
•
Can the child sit all the way back
against their vehicle seat backrest with
knees bent comfortably at the edge of
the seat cushion?
•
Can the child sit without slouching?
•
Does the lap belt rest low across the
hips?
•
Is the shoulder belt centered on the
shoulder and chest?
•
Can the child stay seated like this for
the whole trip?
Always use booster seats in conjunction
with your vehicle lap and shoulder belt.
Types of Booster Seats
•
Backless booster seats
If your backless booster seat has a
removable shield, remove the shield. If a
vehicle seating position has a low seat
backrest or no head restraint, a backless
booster seat may place your child's head
(as measured at the tops of the ears)
above the top of the seat. In this case,
move the backless booster to another
seating position with a higher seat backrest
or head restraint and lap and shoulder
belts, or consider using a high back booster
seat.
•
High back booster seats
If, with a backless booster seat, you cannot
find a seating position that adequately
supports your child's head, a high back
booster seat would be a better choice.
26
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Child Safety
Children and booster seats vary in size and
shape. Choose a booster that keeps the
lap belt low and snug across the hips,
never up across the stomach, and lets you
adjust the shoulder belt to cross the chest
and rest snugly near the center of the
shoulder. The following drawings compare
the ideal fit (center) to a shoulder belt
uncomfortably close to the neck and a
shoulder belt that could slip off the
shoulder. The drawings also show how the
lap belt should be low and snug across the
child's hips.
If the booster seat slides on the vehicle
seat upon which it is being used, placing a
rubberized mesh sold as shelf or carpet
liner under the booster seat may improve
this condition. Do not introduce any item
thicker than this under the booster seat.
Check with the booster seat
manufacturer's instructions.
CHILD RESTRAINT
POSITIONING
WARNING: Do not place a
rearward facing child restraint in front of
an active airbag. Failure to follow this

Child Safety
WARNING: Properly secure
children 12 years old and under in a rear
seating position whenever possible. If
you are unable to properly secure all
children in a rear seating position,
properly secure the largest child on the
front seat. If you must use a forward
facing child restraint on the front seat,
move the seat as far back as possible.
Failure to follow these instructions could
result in personal injury or death.
WARNING: Always carefully
follow the instructions and warnings
provided by the manufacturer of any
child restraint to determine if the
restraint device is appropriate for your
child's size, height, weight, or age. Follow
the child restraint manufacturer's
instructions and warnings provided for
installation and use in conjunction with
the instructions and warnings provided
by your vehicle manufacturer. A safety
seat that is improperly installed or
utilized, is inappropriate for your child's
height, age, or weight or does not
properly fit the child may increase the
risk of serious injury or death.
WARNING: Do not allow a
passenger to hold a child on their lap
when your vehicle is moving. Failure to
follow this instruction could result in
personal injury or death in the event of a
sudden stop or crash.
WARNING: Do not use pillows,
books or towels to boost your child's
height. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in personal injury or death.
WARNING: Properly secure child
restraints or booster seats when they are
not in use. They could become projectiles
in a sudden stop or crash. Failure to
follow this instruction could result in
personal injury or death.
WARNING: Do not put the
shoulder section of the seatbelt or allow
the child to put the shoulder section of
the seatbelt under their arm or behind
their back. Failure to follow this
instruction could reduce the
effectiveness of the seatbelt and
increase the risk of injury or death in a

always properly wear their seatbelts,
even when an airbag supplemental
restraint system is provided. Failure to
properly wear your seatbelts could
seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
WARNING: It is extremely
dangerous to ride in a cargo area, inside
or outside of a vehicle. In a crash, people
riding in these areas are more likely to be
seriously injured or killed. Do not allow
people to ride in any area of your vehicle
that is not equipped with seats and
seatbelts. Be sure everyone in your
vehicle is in a seat and using a seatbelt
properly.
WARNING: In a rollover crash, an
unbelted person is significantly more
likely to die than a person wearing a
seatbelt.
WARNING: Each seating position
in your vehicle has a specific seatbelt
assembly which is made up of one
buckle and one tongue that are designed
to be used as a pair. 1) Use the shoulder
belt on the outside shoulder only. Never
wear the shoulder belt under the arm. 2)
Never swing the seatbelt around your
neck over the inside shoulder. 3) Never
use a single belt for more than one
person.
WARNING: When possible, all
children 12 years old and under should
be properly restrained in a rear seating
position. Failure to follow this could
seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
WARNING: Seatbelts and seats
can become hot in a vehicle that has
been closed up in sunny weather; they
could burn a small child. Check seat
covers and buckles before you place a
child anywhere near them.
WARNING: Front and rear seat
occupants, including pregnant women,
should wear seatbelts for optimum
protection in an accident.
All seating positions in your vehicle have
lap and shoulder seatbelts. All occupants
of the vehicle should always properly wear
their seatbelts, even when an airbag
supplemental restraint system is provided.
The seatbelt system consists of:
•
Lap and shoulder seatbelts.
•
Shoulder seatbelt with automatic
locking mode, (except driver seatbelt).
•
Height adjuster at the front outboard
seating positions.

•
Seatbelt pretensioner at the front
outboard seating positions.
•
Belt tension sensor at the front
outboard passenger seating position.
· Seatbelt warning light and
chime.
· Crash sensors and monitoring
system with readiness indicator.
The seatbelt pretensioners at the front
seating positions are designed to tighten
the seatbelts when activated. In frontal
and near-frontal crashes, the seatbelt
pretensioners may be activated alone or,
if the crash is of sufficient severity, together
with the front airbags. The pretensioners
will activate when the Safety Canopy is
deployed.
FASTENING THE SEATBELTS
The front outboard and rear safety
restraints in the vehicle are combination
lap and shoulder belts.
1.
Insert the belt tongue into the proper
buckle (the buckle closest to the
direction the tongue is coming from)
until you hear a snap and feel it latch.
Make sure you securely fasten the
tongue in the buckle.
2.
To unfasten, press the release button
and remove the tongue from the
buckle.
Using the Sliding Clip (If Equipped)
Slide the clip away from the seatbelt
tongue so there is no loose webbing when
an occupant or child restraint is fastened.
You can also use the sliding clip to raise
the seatbelt tongue and prevent it from
rattling or to ease access to the seatbelt
tongue.

Seatbelts
Using Seatbelts During Pregnancy
WARNING: Always ride and drive
with your seatback upright and properly
fasten your seatbelt. Fit the lap portion
of the seatbelt snugly and low across
the hips. Position the shoulder portion of
the seatbelt across your chest. Pregnant
women must follow this practice. See
the following figure.
Pregnant women should always wear their
seatbelt.  Position the lap belt portion of a
combination lap and shoulder belt low
across the hips below the belly and worn
as tight as comfort allows.  Position the
shoulder belt to cross the middle of the
shoulder and the center of the chest.
Seatbelt Locking Modes
WARNING: You must replace the
seatbelt if the automatic locking
retractor or any other seatbelt function
is not operating correctly. Failure to
replace the seatbelt and retractor
assembly could increase the risk of injury
in a crash.
All safety restraints in the vehicle are
combination lap and shoulder belts. The
driver seatbelt has the vehicle sensitive
locking mode. The front outboard
passenger and rear seat seatbelts have
both the vehicle sensitive locking mode
and the automatic locking mode.
Vehicle Sensitive Mode
This is the normal retractor mode, which
allows free shoulder belt length
adjustment to your movements and
locking in response to vehicle movement.
For example, if the driver brakes suddenly
or turns a corner sharply, or the vehicle
receives an impact of about 5 mph
(8 km/h) or more, the combination
seatbelts lock to help reduce forward
movement of the driver and passengers.
In addition, the retractor is designed to lock
if you pull the webbing out too quickly. If
the seatbelt retractor locks, slowly lower
the height adjuster to allow the seatbelt
to retract. If the retractor does not unlock,
pull the seatbelt out slowly then feed a
small length of webbing back toward the
stowed position. For rear seatbelts, recline
the rear seat backrest or push the seat
backrest cushion away from the seatbelt.
Feed a small length of webbing back
toward the stowed position.
Automatic Locking Mode
In this mode, the shoulder belt
automatically pre-locks. The belt retracts
to remove any slack in the shoulder belt.
The automatic locking mode is not
available on the driver seatbelt.

Seatbelts
When to Use the Automatic Locking
Mode
Use this mode when you install a child
safety seat, except a booster seat, in the
passenger front or rear seating positions.
Properly restrain children 12 years old and
under in a rear seating position whenever
possible.  See Child Safety (page 18).
How to Use the Automatic Locking
Mode
1.
Buckle the combination lap and
shoulder belt.
2.
Grasp the shoulder portion and pull
downward until you pull the entire belt
out. As the belt retracts, you will hear
a clicking sound. This indicates the
seatbelt is now in the automatic
locking mode.
How to Disengage the Automatic
Locking Mode
Unbuckle the combination lap and
shoulder belt and allow it to retract
completely to disengage the automatic
locking mode and activate the vehicle
sensitive (emergency) locking mode.
SEATBELT HEIGHT
ADJUSTMENT (IF EQUIPPED)
WARNING: Position the seatbelt
height adjuster so that the seatbelt rests
across the middle of your shoulder.
Failure to adjust the seatbelt correctly
could reduce its effectiveness and
increase the risk of injury in a crash.
1.
Pull the button and slide the height
adjuster up or down.
2.
Release the button and pull down on
the height adjuster to make sure it is
locked in place.

lamp when you are in the driver seat or you
have a front seat passenger and a seatbelt
is unbuckled.
The system uses information from the
front passenger sensing system to
determine if a front seat passenger is
present and therefore potentially in need
of a warning. To avoid the system turning
on the Belt-Minder feature for objects you
place on the front passenger seat, only the
front seat passengers receive warnings as

CHILD RESTRAINT AND
SEATBELT MAINTENANCE
Inspect the vehicle seatbelts and child
safety seat systems periodically to make
sure they work properly and are not
damaged. Inspect the vehicle and child
restraint seatbelts to make sure there are
no nicks, tears or cuts. Replace if
necessary. All vehicle seatbelt assemblies,
including retractors, buckles, front seatbelt
buckle assemblies, buckle support
assemblies (slide bar-if equipped),
shoulder belt height adjusters (if
equipped), shoulder belt guide on seat
backrest (if equipped), child safety seat
LATCH and tether anchors, and attaching
hardware, should be inspected after a
crash. Read the child restraint
manufacturer's instructions for additional
inspection and maintenance information
specific to the child restraint.
We recommend that all seatbelt
assemblies in use in vehicles involved in a
crash be replaced. However, if the crash
was minor and an authorized dealer finds
that the belts do not show damage and
continue to operate properly, they do not
need to be replaced. Seatbelt assemblies
not in use during a crash should also be
inspected and replaced if either damage
or improper operation is noted.
Properly care for seatbelts.  See Seatbelts
(page 31).
SEATBELT EXTENSION
WARNING: Persons who fit into
the vehicle's seatbelt should not use an
extension. Unnecessary use could result
in serious personal injury in the event of
a crash.
WARNING: Only use extensions
provided free of charge by our dealers.
The dealer will provide an extension
designed specifically for this vehicle,
model year and seating position. The use
of an extension intended for another
vehicle, model year or seating position
may not offer you the full protection of
your vehicle's seatbelt restraint system.
WARNING: Never use seatbelt
extensions to install child restraints.
WARNING: Do not use a seatbelt
extension with an inflatable seatbelt.
WARNING: Do not use extensions
to change the way the seatbelt fits
across the torso, over the lap or to make
the seatbelt buckle easier to reach.
If, because of body size or driving position,
it is not possible to properly fasten the
seatbelt over your lap and shoulder, an
extension that is compatible with the
seatbelts is available free of charge from
our dealers. Only use our seatbelt
extensions made by the original equipment
seatbelt manufacturer with our seatbelts.
Ask your authorized dealer if your extension
is compatible with your vehicle restraint
system.

Seatbelts
The Personal Safety System provides an
improved overall level of frontal crash
protection to front seat occupants and is
designed to help further reduce the risk of
airbag-related injuries. The system is able
to analyze different occupant conditions
and crash severity before activating the
appropriate safety devices to help better
protect a range of occupants in a variety
of frontal crash situations.
The Vehicle Personal Safety System
consists of:
•
Driver and passenger dual-stage airbag
supplemental restraints.
•
Front seat outermost seatbelts with
pretensioners, energy management
retractors and seatbelt usage sensors.
•
Driver seat position sensor.
•
Passenger seat position sensor.
•
Front passenger sensing system.
•
Passenger airbag off and on indicators.
•
Front crash severity sensors.
•
Restraints control module with impact
and safing sensors.
•
Restraint system warning lamp and
tone.
•
The electrical wiring for the airbags,
crash sensors, seatbelt pretensioners,
front seatbelt usage sensors, driver
seat position sensor, front passenger
sensing system and indicators.
How Does the Personal Safety
System Work?
The Personal Safety System can adapt the
deployment strategy of the safety devices
according to crash severity and occupant
conditions. A collection of crash and
occupant sensors provides information to
the restraints control module. During a
crash, the restraints control module may
deploy the seatbelt pretensioners, one or
both stages of the dual-stage airbags
based on crash severity and occupant
conditions.

Personal Safety System™
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
WARNING: Airbags do not inflate
slowly or gently, and the risk of injury
from a deploying airbag is the greatest
close to the trim covering the airbag
module.
WARNING: All occupants of your
vehicle, including the driver, should
always properly wear their seatbelts,
even when an airbag supplemental
restraint system is provided. Failure to
properly wear your seatbelt could
seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
WARNING: Even with advanced
restraints systems, properly restrain
children 12 and under in a rear seating
position. Failure to follow this could
seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
WARNING: Do not place your arms
on the airbag cover or through the
steering wheel. Failure to follow this
instruction could result in personal injury.
WARNING: Keep the areas in front
of the airbags free from obstruction. Do
not affix anything to or over the airbag
covers. Objects could become projectiles
during airbag deployment or in a sudden
stop. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in personal injury or death.
WARNING: Airbags can kill or
injure a child in a child restraint. Never
place a rear-facing child restraint in front
of an active airbag. If you must use a
forward-facing child restraint in the front
seat, move the seat upon which the child
restraint is installed all the way back.
WARNING: Do not attempt to
service, repair, or modify the
supplementary restraint system or
associated components. Failure to
follow this instruction could result in
personal injury or death.
WARNING: Several airbag system
components get hot after inflation. To
reduce the risk of injury, do not touch
them after inflation.
WARNING: If a supplementary
restraint system component has
deployed, it will not function again. Have
the system and associated components
inspected as soon as possible. Failure to
follow this instruction could result in
personal injury or death.
The airbags are a supplemental restraint
system and are designed to work with the
seatbelts to help protect the driver and
right front passenger from certain upper
body injuries. Airbags do not inflate slowly;
there is a risk of injury from a deploying
airbag.
Note: You will hear a loud bang and see a
cloud of harmless powdery residue if an
airbag deploys. This is normal.
The airbags inflate and deflate rapidly
upon activation.  After airbag deployment,
it is normal to notice a smoke-like, powdery
residue or smell the burnt propellant.  This
may consist of cornstarch, talcum powder
(to lubricate the bag) or sodium
compounds (for example, baking soda)
that result from the combustion process
that inflates the airbag.  Small amounts of
sodium hydroxide may be present which
may irritate the skin and eyes, but none of
the residue is toxic.

Supplementary Restraints System
While the system is designed to help
reduce serious injuries, contact with a
deploying airbag may also cause abrasions
or swelling. Temporary hearing loss is also
a possibility as a result of the noise
associated with a deploying airbag.
Because airbags must inflate rapidly and
with considerable force, there is the risk of
death or serious injuries such as fractures,
facial and eye injuries or internal injuries,
particularly to occupants who are not
properly restrained or are otherwise out of
position at the time of airbag deployment.
Thus, it is extremely important that
occupants be properly restrained as far
away from the airbag module as possible
while maintaining vehicle control.
Routine maintenance of the airbags is not
required.
DRIVER AND PASSENGER
AIRBAGS
WARNING: Do not place your arms
on the airbag cover or through the
steering wheel. Failure to follow this
instruction could result in personal injury.
WARNING: Keep the areas in front
of the airbags free from obstruction. Do
not affix anything to or over the airbag
covers. Objects could become projectiles
during airbag deployment or in a sudden
stop. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in personal injury or death.
WARNING: Airbags can kill or
injure a child in a child restraint. Never
place a rear-facing child restraint in front
of an active airbag. If you must use a
forward-facing child restraint in the front
seat, move the seat upon which the child
restraint is installed all the way back.
The driver and front passenger airbags will
deploy during significant frontal and near
frontal crashes.
The driver and passenger front airbag
system consists of:
•
Driver and passenger airbag modules.
•
Front passenger sensing system.
· Crash sensors and monitoring
system with readiness indicator.
See Crash Sensors and Airbag
Indicator (page 47).
Proper Driver and Front Passenger
Seating Adjustment
WARNING: National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
recommends a minimum distance of at
least 10 in (25 cm) between an
occupant's chest and the driver airbag
module.
To properly position yourself away from
the airbag:
•
Move your seat to the rear as far as you
can while still reaching the pedals
comfortably.
•
Recline the seat slightly (one or two
degrees) from the upright position.

Supplementary Restraints System
After all occupants have adjusted their
seats and put on seatbelts, it is very
important that they continue to sit
properly. A properly seated occupant sits
upright, leaning against the seatback, and
centered on the seat cushion, with their
feet comfortably extended on the floor.
Sitting improperly can increase the chance
of injury in a crash event. For example, if
an occupant slouches, lies down, turns
sideways, sits forward, leans forward or
sideways, or puts one or both feet up, the
chance of injury during a crash is greatly
increased.
Children and Airbags
WARNING: Airbags can kill or
injure a child in a child restraint. Never
place a rear-facing child restraint in front
of an active airbag. If you must use a
forward-facing child restraint in the front
seat, move the seat upon which the child
restraint is installed all the way back.
Children must always be properly
restrained. Accident statistics suggest that
children are safer when properly restrained
in the rear seating positions than in the
front seating position. Failure to follow
these instructions may increase the risk of
injury in a crash.
FRONT PASSENGER SENSING
SYSTEM
WARNING: Even with advanced
restraints systems, properly restrain
children 12 and under in a rear seating
position. Failure to follow this could
seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
WARNING: Sitting improperly, out
of position or with the seatback reclined
too far can take weight off the seat
cushion and affect the decision of the
passenger sensing system, resulting in
serious injury or death in the event of a
crash. Always sit upright against your
seat back, with your feet on the floor.
WARNING: Any alteration or
modification to the front passenger seat
may affect the performance of the front
passenger sensing system. This could
seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
This system works with sensors that are
part of the front passenger’s seat and
seatbelt to detect the presence of a
properly-seated occupant and determine
if the front passenger’s frontal airbag
should be enabled (may inflate) or not.

Supplementary Restraints System
The front passenger sensing system uses
a passenger airbag status indicator that
will illuminate indicating that the front
passenger frontal airbag is either ON
(enabled) or OFF (disabled).
The indicator lamp is located at the
overhead console.
Note:  The passenger airbag status
indicator OFF and ON indicator lamps will
illuminate for a short period of time when
the ignition is first turned on to confirm they
are functional.
The front passenger sensing system is
designed to disable (will not inflate) the
front passenger's frontal airbag when a
rear facing infant seat, a forward-facing
child restraint, or a booster seat is
detected. Even with this technology,
parents are strongly encouraged to
always properly restrain children in the rear
seat.
•
When the front passenger sensing
system disables (will not inflate) the
front passenger frontal airbag, the
passenger airbag status indicator will
illuminate the OFF lamp and stay lit to
remind you that the front passenger
frontal airbag is disabled.
•
If the child restraint has been installed
and the passenger airbag status
indicator illuminates the ON lamp, then
turn the vehicle off, remove the child
restraint from the vehicle and reinstall
the restraint following the child
restraint manufacturer's instructions.
The front passenger sensing system is
designed to enable (may inflate) the front
passenger's frontal airbag anytime the
system senses that a person of adult size
is sitting properly in the front passenger
seat.
•
When the front passenger sensing
system enables the front passenger
frontal airbag (may inflate), the
passenger airbag status indicator will
illuminate the ON lamp and remain
illuminated.
If a person of adult size is sitting in the front
passenger’s seat, but the airbag off
indicator lamp is lit, it is possible that the
person is not sitting properly in the seat. If
this happens:
•
Turn the vehicle off and ask the person
to place the seatback in a more upright
positon.
•
Have the person sit upright in the seat,
centered on the seat cushion, with the
person’s legs comfortably extended.
•
Restart the vehicle and have the person
remain in this position for about two
minutes. This will allow the system to
detect that person and enable the
passenger’s frontal airbag.
•
If the indicator OFF lamp remains lit
even after this, the person should be
advised to ride in the rear seat.

If you think that the status of the passenger
airbag off indicator lamp is incorrect, check
for the following:
•
Objects lodged underneath the seat
•
Objects between the seat cushion and
the center console
•
Objects hanging off the seat back
•
Objects stowed in the seat back map
pocket
•
Objects placed on the occupant's lap
•
Cargo interference with the seat
•
Other passengers pushing or pulling on
the seat
•
Rear passenger feet and knees resting
or pushing on the seat
The conditions listed above may cause the
weight of a properly seated occupant to
be incorrectly interpreted by the front
passenger sensing system. The person in
the front passenger seat may appear
heavier or lighter due to the conditions
described in the list above.
Make sure the front passenger
sensing system is operating
properly.  See Front Passenger
Sensing System (page 41).
Do not attempt to repair or service the
system. Take your vehicle immediately to
an authorized dealer.
If it is necessary to modify an advanced
front airbag system to accommodate a
person with disabilities, contact the Ford
Customer Relationship Center.  See Front
Passenger Sensing System (page 41).

Crash sensors and monitoring
system with readiness indicator.
See Side Airbags (page 43).
The design and development of the side
airbag system included recommended
testing procedures that were developed
by a group of automotive safety experts
known as the Side Airbag Technical
Working Group. These recommended
testing procedures help reduce the risk of
injuries related to the deployment of side
airbags.
DRIVER AND PASSENGER
KNEE AIRBAGS
WARNING: To reduce risk of injury,
do not obstruct or place objects in the
deployment path of the airbag.
WARNING: Close the glove box
door when your vehicle is moving. Failure
to follow this instruction could reduce
the effectiveness of the passenger knee
airbag and increase the risk of injury in a
crash.
A driver knee airbag is located under or
within the instrument panel. A passenger
knee airbag is located within or under the
glove box door. During a crash, the
restraints control module may activate the
driver and passenger knee airbags based
on crash severity and occupant conditions.
Under certain crash and occupant
conditions, the driver and passenger knee
airbag may deploy but the driver front
airbag may not activate. As with front and
side airbags, it is important to be properly
seated and restrained to reduce the risk of
death or serious injury.
Make sure the knee airbags are
operating properly.  See Crash
Sensors and Airbag Indicator
(page 47).
SAFETY CANOPY™
WARNING: Do not place objects
or mount equipment on or near the
headliner at the siderail that may come
into contact with a deploying curtain
airbag. Failure to follow these
instructions may increase the risk of
personal injury in the event of a crash.
WARNING: Do not lean your head
on the door. The curtain airbag could
injure you as it deploys from the
headliner.
WARNING: Do not attempt to
service, repair, or modify the
supplementary restraint system or
associated components. Failure to
follow this instruction could result in
personal injury or death.

Supplementary Restraints System
WARNING: All occupants of your
vehicle, including the driver, should
always properly wear their seatbelts,
even when an airbag supplemental
restraint system is provided. Failure to
properly wear your seatbelt could
seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
WARNING: To reduce risk of injury,
do not obstruct or place objects in the
deployment path of the airbag.
WARNING: If a supplementary
restraint system component has
deployed, it will not function again. Have
the system and associated components
inspected as soon as possible. Failure to
follow this instruction could result in
personal injury or death.
The Safety Canopy deploys during
significant side crashes or when a certain
likelihood of a rollover event is detected
by the rollover sensor. The Safety Canopy
is mounted to the roof side rail sheet metal,
behind the headliner, above each row of
seats. In certain sideways crashes or
rollover events, the Safety Canopy will be
activated, regardless of which seats are
occupied. The Safety Canopy is designed
to inflate between the side window area
and occupants to further enhance
protection provided in side impact crashes
and rollover events.
The system consists of the following:
•
Safety Canopy curtain airbags above
the trim panels over the front and rear
side windows identified by a label or
wording on the headliner or roof-pillar
trim.
•
A flexible headliner which opens above
the side doors to allow air curtain
deployment
· Crash sensors and monitoring
system with a readiness
indicator.  See Crash Sensors
and Airbag Indicator (page 47).
Properly restrain children 12 years old and
under in the rear seats. The Safety Canopy
will not interfere with children restrained
using a properly installed child or booster
seat because it is designed to inflate
downward from the headliner above the
doors along the side window opening.
The design and development of the Safety
Canopy included recommended testing
procedures that were developed by a
group of automotive safety experts known
as the Side Airbag Technical Working
Group. These recommended testing
procedures help reduce the risk of injuries
related to the deployment of side airbags
(including the Safety Canopy).

Supplementary Restraints System
CRASH SENSORS AND
AIRBAG INDICATOR
WARNING: Modifying or adding
equipment to the front end of your
vehicle (including hood, bumper system,
frame, front end body structure, tow
hooks and hood pins) may affect the
performance of the airbag system,
increasing the risk of injury. Do not
modify or add equipment to the front
end of your vehicle.
Your vehicle has a collection of crash and
occupant sensors which provide
information to the restraints control
module. The restraints control module
deploys (activates) the front seatbelt
pretensioners, driver airbag, passenger
airbag, knee airbag(s), seat mounted side
airbags and Safety Canopy airbags. Based
on the type of crash, the restraints control
module deploys the appropriate safety
devices.
The restraints control module also
monitors the readiness of the above safety
devices plus the crash and occupant
sensors. The readiness of the safety
system is indicated by a warning indicator
light in the instrument cluster or by a
backup tone if the warning light is not
working. Routine maintenance of the
airbag is not required.
A difficulty with the system is indicated by
one or more of the following:
•
The readiness light will not illuminate
immediately after the ignition is
switched on.
•
The readiness light either flashes or
stays lit.
•
A series of five beeps will be heard. The
tone pattern repeats periodically until
the problem, the light or both are
repaired.
If any of these things happen, even
intermittently, have the supplemental
restraint system serviced at an authorized
dealer immediately. Unless serviced, the
system may not function properly in the
event of a crash.
The seatbelt pretensioners and the front
airbag supplemental restraint system are
designed to activate when the vehicle
sustains frontal deceleration sufficient to
cause the restraints control module to
deploy a safety device.
The fact that the seatbelt pretensioners
or front airbags did not activate for both
front seat occupants in a crash does not
mean that something is wrong with the
system. Rather, it means the restraints
control module determined the accident
conditions (crash severity, belt usage)
were not appropriate to activate these
safety devices.
•
The design of the front airbags is to
activate only in frontal and near-frontal
crashes (not rollovers, side impacts or
rear impacts) unless the crash causes
sufficient frontal deceleration.
•
The design of the seatbelt
pretensioners is to activate in frontal,
near-frontal and side crashes, and in
rollovers.
•
The knee airbag(s) may deploy based
on crash severity and occupant
conditions.

Supplementary Restraints System
•
The design of the side airbags is to
inflate in certain side impact crashes.
Side airbags may activate in other
types of crashes if the vehicles
experiences sufficient sideways motion
or deformation.
•
The design of the Safety Canopy is to
inflate in certain side impact crashes
or rollover events. The Safety Canopy
may activate in other types of crashes
if the vehicle experiences sufficient
sideways motion or deformation, or a
certain likelihood of rollover.
AIRBAG DISPOSAL
Contact your authorized dealer as soon as
possible. Airbags must be disposed of by
qualified personnel.

Supplementary Restraints System
ABOUT 911 ASSIST
911 Assist is a SYNC system feature that
can call for help if you’re in an accident. If
a crash deploys an airbag (excluding knee
airbags and rear inflatable seatbelts [if
equipped]) or activates the fuel pump
shut-off, your SYNC-equipped vehicle may
be able to contact emergency services by
dialing 911 through a paired and connected
Bluetooth-enabled phone. You can learn
more about the 911 Assist feature, by
visiting:
Website
www.owner.ford.com
www.syncmyride.ca
www.syncmaroute.ca
Not all crashes will deploy an airbag or
activate the fuel pump shut-off (the
triggers for 911 Assist). If a connected cell
phone sustains damage or loses its
connection to SYNC during a crash, SYNC
will search for and try to connect to a
previously paired cell phone; SYNC will
then attempt to call the emergency
services.
Before making the call:
•
SYNC provides a short window of time
(about 10 seconds) to cancel the call.
If you fail to cancel the call, SYNC
attempts to dial 911.
•
SYNC says the following, or a similar
message: "SYNC will attempt to call
911, to cancel the call, press Cancel on
your screen or press and hold the
phone button on your steering wheel."
If you do not cancel the call, and SYNC
makes a successful call, a pre-recorded
message plays for the 911 operator, and
then the occupant(s) in your vehicle is able
to talk with the operator. Be prepared to
provide your name, phone number and
location immediately, because not all 911
systems are capable of receiving this
information electronically.
During an emergency call, the system
transmits vehicle data to the emergency
service.  See Data Recording (page 9).
EMERGENCY CALL
REQUIREMENTS
WARNING: Do not wait for 911
Assist to make an emergency call if you
can do it yourself. Dial emergency
services immediately to avoid delayed
response time which could increase the
risk of serious injury or death after a
crash. If you do not hear 911 Assist within
five seconds of the crash, the system or
phone may be damaged or
non-functional.
WARNING: Always place your
phone in a secure location in your vehicle
so it does not become a projectile or get
damaged in a crash. Failure to do so may
cause serious injury to someone or
damage the phone which could prevent
911 Assist from working properly.
WARNING: Unless the 911 Assist
setting is set on before a crash, the
system will not dial for help which could
delay response time, potentially
increasing the risk of serious injury or
death after a crash.

PASSIVE ANTI-THEFT
SYSTEM
Principle of Operation
The system prevents someone from
starting the engine with an incorrectly
coded key.
Note:  The system is not compatible with
non-Ford aftermarket remote start systems.
Use of these systems may result in engine
starting problems and a loss of security
protection
Note: Metallic objects, electronic devices
or a second coded key on the same key
chain may result in vehicle starting
problems, especially if they are too close to
the key when starting your vehicle. Prevent
these objects from touching the coded key
when starting your vehicle. Switch the
ignition off, move all objects on the key
chain away from the coded key and restart
your vehicle if a problem occurs.
Note:  Do not leave a duplicate coded key
in your vehicle.  Always take your keys and
lock all doors when leaving your vehicle.
SecuriLock®
The system is an engine immobilization
system.  It is designed to help prevent the
engine from being started unless a coded
key programmed to your vehicle is used.
Using the wrong key may prevent the
engine from starting.  A message may
appear in the information display.
If you are unable to start the engine with a
correctly coded key, a malfunction has
happened and a message may appear in
the information display.
Automatic Arming
When you switch the ignition off the engine
immobilizer will arm automatically after a
short time.
Automatic Disarming
When you switch the ignition on, the engine
immobilizer will disarm automatically if a
correctly coded key is used. If you are
unable to start the engine with a correctly
coded key, have your vehicle checked by
an Authorized Dealer.
Replacement Keys
Note: Your vehicle comes equipped with
two remote controls with a folding key blade
or two intelligent access keys.
The remote controls with a folding key
blade functions as a programmed ignition
key that operates all the locks and starts
the vehicle, as well as a remote control.
The intelligent access key functions as a
programmed key that operates the driver
door lock and activates the intelligent
access with push button start system, as
well as a remote control.
If your programmed transmitters or
standard SecuriLock® coded keys are lost
or stolen and you do not have an extra
coded key, you will need to have your
vehicle towed to an authorized dealer.  You
need to erase the key codes from your
vehicle and program new coded keys.
Store an extra programmed key away from
the vehicle in a safe place to help prevent
any inconveniences. See your authorized
dealer to purchase additional spare or
replacement keys. Have replacement keys
coded together with recoding your
remaining keys.
Note: Have all of your remaining keys
erased and recoded if you lose a key. Have
replacement keys coded together with
recoding your remaining keys. See an
authorized dealer for further information.
Note: Do not shield your keys with metal
objects. This may prevent the receiver from
recognizing a coded key.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Condensation in the Exterior Front
Lamps and Rear Lamps
Exterior front lamps and rear lamps have
vents to accommodate normal changes
in air pressure.
Condensation can be a natural by-product
of this design. When moist air enters the
lamp assembly through the vents, there is
a possibility that condensation can occur
when the temperature is cold. When
normal condensation occurs, a fine mist
can form on the interior of the lens. The
fine mist eventually clears and exits
through the vents during normal operation.
Clearing time may take as long as 48 hours
under dry weather conditions.
Examples of acceptable condensation are:
•
The presence of a fine mist (no streaks,
drip marks or large droplets).
•
A fine mist covers less than 50% of the
lens.
Examples of unacceptable condensation
are:
•
A water puddle inside the lamp.
•
Streaks, drip marks or large droplets
present on the interior of the lens.
If you see any unacceptable condensation,
have your vehicle checked by an authorized
dealer.

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
Outside Air
Keep the air intakes in front of the
windshield free from obstruction (such as
snow or leaves) to allow the climate
control system to function effectively.
Recirculated Air
The air currently in the passenger
compartment recirculates. Outside air does
not enter your vehicle.
Note: Prolonged use of recirculated air may
cause the windows to fog up.
Heating
Heating performance depends on the
temperature of the coolant.
General Information on Controlling
the Interior Climate
Close the windows.
Warming the Interior
Direct the air toward your feet. In cold or
humid weather conditions, direct some of
the air toward the windshield and the door
windows.
Cooling the Interior
Direct the air toward your face.
Air Conditioning
The system directs condensation to the
outside of your vehicle, which could cause
a small pool of water to form under your
vehicle.  This is normal.
Note: The air conditioning operates only
when the temperature is above 39°F (4°C).
Note: When you use air conditioning, your
vehicle uses more fuel.

ENGINE BLOCK HEATER (IF
EQUIPPED)
WARNING: Failure to follow
engine block heater instructions could
result in property damage or serious
personal injury.
WARNING: Do not use your heater
with ungrounded electrical systems or
two-pronged adapters. There is a risk of
electrical shock.
WARNING: Do not fully close the
hood, or allow it to drop under its own
weight when using the engine block
heater. This could damage the power
cable and may cause an electrical short
resulting in fire, injury and property
damage.
Note: The heater is most effective when
outdoor temperatures are below 0°F
(-18°C).
The heater acts as a starting aid by
warming the engine coolant. This allows
the climate control system to respond
quickly. The equipment includes a heater
element (installed in the engine block) and
a wire harness. You can connect the
system to a grounded 120-volt AC
electrical source.
We recommend that you do the following
for a safe and correct operation:
•
Use a 16-gauge outdoor extension cord
that is product certified by
Underwriter’s Laboratory (UL) or
Canadian Standards Association
(CSA). This extension cord must be
suitable for use outdoors, in cold
temperatures, and be clearly marked
Suitable for Use with Outdoor
Appliances. Do not use an indoor
extension cord outdoors. This could
result in an electric shock or become a
fire hazard.
•
Use as short an extension cord as
possible.
•
Do not use multiple extension cords.
•
Make sure that when in operation, the
extension cord plug and heater cord
plug connections are free and clear of
water. This could cause an electric
shock or fire.
•
Make sure your vehicle is parked in a
clean area, clear of combustibles.
•
Make sure the heater, heater cord and
extension cord are firmly connected.
•
Check for heat anywhere in the
electrical hookup once the system has
been operating for approximately 30
minutes.
134

Starting and Stopping the Engine
•
Make sure the system is unplugged and
properly stowed before starting and
driving your vehicle. Make sure the
protective cover seals the prongs of the
block heater cord plug when not in use.
•
Make sure the heater system is
checked for proper operation before
winter.
Using the Engine Block Heater
Make sure the receptacle terminals are
clean and dry prior to use. Clean them with
a dry cloth if necessary.
The heater uses 0.4 to 1.0 kilowatt-hours
of energy per hour of use. The system does
not have a thermostat. It achieves
maximum temperature after
approximately three hours of operation.
Using the heater longer than three hours
does not improve system performance and
unnecessarily uses electricity.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
WARNING: Do not overfill the fuel
tank. The pressure in an overfilled tank
may cause leakage and lead to fuel spray
and fire.
WARNING: The fuel system may
be under pressure. If you hear a hissing
sound near the fuel filler inlet, do not
refuel until the sound stops. Otherwise,
fuel may spray out, which could cause
serious personal injury.
WARNING: Fuels can cause
serious injury or death if misused or
mishandled.
WARNING: Fuel may contain
benzene, which is a cancer-causing
agent.
WARNING: When refueling always
shut the engine off and never allow
sparks or open flames near the fuel tank
filler valve. Never smoke or use a cell
phone while refueling. Fuel vapor is
extremely hazardous under certain
conditions. Avoid inhaling excess fumes.
Follow these guidelines when refueling:
•
Extinguish all smoking materials and
any open flames before refueling your
vehicle.
•
Always switch the engine off before
refueling.
•
Automotive fuels can be harmful or
fatal if swallowed. Fuel is highly toxic
and if swallowed can cause death or
permanent injury. If fuel is swallowed
immediately call a physician, even if no
symptoms are immediately apparent.
The toxic effects of fuel may not be
apparent for hours.
•
Avoid inhaling fuel vapors.  Inhaling fuel
vapor can lead to eye and respiratory
tract irritation.  In severe cases,
excessive or prolonged breathing of
fuel vapor can cause serious illness and
permanent injury.
•
Avoid getting fuel in your eyes. If you
splash fuel in your eyes, immediately
remove contact lenses (if worn), flush
with water for 15 minutes and seek
medical attention.  Failure to seek
proper medical attention could lead to
permanent injury.
•
Fuels can be harmful if absorbed
through the skin. If you splash fuel on
your skin, clothing or both, promptly
remove contaminated clothing and
thoroughly wash your skin with soap
and water. Repeated or prolonged skin
contact causes skin irritation.
•
Be particularly careful if you are taking
Antabuse or other forms of Disulfiram
for the treatment of alcoholism.
Breathing fuel vapors could cause an
adverse reaction, serious personal
injury or sickness. Immediately call a
physician if you experience any adverse
reactions.
FUEL QUALITY - GASOLINE
Choosing the Right Fuel
Your vehicle is designed to operate on
regular unleaded gasoline with a minimum
pump (R+M)/2 octane rating of 87.
138
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Fuel and Refueling
Some fuel stations, particularly those in
high altitude areas, offer fuels posted as
regular unleaded gasoline with an octane
rating below 87. The use of these fuels
could result in engine damage that will not
be covered by the vehicle warranty.
For best overall vehicle and engine
performance, premium fuel with an octane
rating of 91 or higher is recommended. The
performance gained by using premium fuel
is most noticeable in hot weather as well
as other conditions, for example when
towing a trailer.  See Towing (page 181).
Do not be concerned if the engine
sometimes knocks lightly.  However, if the
engine knocks heavily while using fuel with
the recommended octane rating, contact
an authorized dealer to prevent any engine
damage.
We recommend Top Tier detergent
gasolines, where available to help minimize
engine deposits and maintain optimal
vehicle and engine performance. For
additional information, refer to
www.toptiergas.com.
Note: Use of any fuel for which the vehicle
was not designed can impair the emission
control system, cause loss of vehicle
performance, and cause damage to the
engine which may not be covered by the
vehicle Warranty.
Do not use:
•
Diesel fuel.
•
Fuels containing kerosene or paraffin.
•
Fuel containing more than 15% ethanol
or E85 fuel.
•
Fuels containing methanol.
•
Fuels containing metallic-based
additives, including manganese-based
compounds.
•
Fuels containing the octane booster
additive, methylcyclopentadienyl
manganese tricarbonyl (MMT).
•
Leaded fuel, using leaded fuel is
prohibited by law.
The use of fuels with metallic compounds
such as methylcyclopentadienyl
manganese tricarbonyl (commonly known
as MMT), which is a manganese-based
fuel additive, will impair engine
performance and affect the emission
control system.
FUEL FILLER FUNNEL
LOCATION
The fuel filler funnel is under the luggage
compartment floor covering.
RUNNING OUT OF FUEL
Running out of fuel can cause damage not
covered by the vehicle Warranty.
If your vehicle runs out of fuel:
•
Add a minimum of 1.3 gal (5 L) of fuel
to restart the engine.
•
You may need to switch the ignition
from off to on several times after
refueling to allow the fuel system to
pump the fuel from the tank to the
engine.  When restarting, cranking time
takes a few seconds longer than
normal.
Note: If your vehicle is on a steep slope,
more fuel may be required.
Filling a Portable Fuel Container
WARNING: Flow of fuel through
a fuel pump nozzle can produce static
electricity. This can cause a fire if you are
filling an ungrounded fuel container.

EMISSION LAW
WARNING: Do not remove or alter
the original equipment floor covering or
insulation between it and the metal floor
of the vehicle. The floor covering and
insulation protect occupants of the
vehicle from the engine and exhaust
system heat and noise. On vehicles with
no original equipment floor covering
insulation, do not carry passengers in a
manner that permits prolonged skin
contact with the metal floor. Failure to
follow these instructions may result in
fire or personal injury.
U.S. federal laws and certain state laws
prohibit removing or rendering inoperative
emission control system components.
Similar federal or provincial laws may
apply in Canada. We do not approve of any
vehicle modification without first
determining applicable laws.
Tampering with emissions
control systems including
related sensors or the Diesel
Exhaust Fluid system can result in reduced
engine power and the illumination of the
service engine soon light.
Tampering With a Noise Control
System
Federal laws prohibit the following acts:
•
Removal or rendering inoperative by
any person other than for purposes of
maintenance.
•
Repair or replacement of any device or
element of the design incorporated into
a new vehicle for the purpose of noise
control prior to its sale or delivery to
the ultimate purchaser or while it is in
use.
•
The use of the vehicle after any person
removes or renders inoperative any
device or element of the design.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
may presume to constitute tampering as
follows:
•
Removal of hood blanket, fender apron
absorbers, fender apron barriers,
underbody noise shields or acoustically
absorptive material.
•
Tampering or rendering inoperative the
engine speed governor, to allow engine
speed to exceed manufacturer
specifications.
If the engine does not start, runs rough,
experiences a decrease in engine
performance, experiences excess fuel
consumption or produces excessive
exhaust smoke, check for the following:
•
A plugged or disconnected air inlet
system hose.
•
A plugged engine air filter element.
•
Water in the fuel filter and water
separator.
•

Noise Emissions Warranty,
Prohibited Tampering Acts and
Maintenance
On January 1, 1978, Federal regulation
became effective governing the noise
emission on trucks over 10,000 lb
(4,536 kg) Gross Vehicle Weight Rating
(GVWR). The preceding statements
concerning prohibited tampering acts and
maintenance, and the noise warranty
found in the Warranty Guide, are
applicable to complete chassis cabs over
10,000 lb (4,536 kg) GVWR.
CATALYTIC CONVERTER
WARNING: Do not park, idle or
drive your vehicle on dry grass or other
dry ground cover. The emission system
heats up the engine compartment and
exhaust system, creating the risk of fire.
WARNING: The normal operating
temperature of the exhaust system is
very high. Never work around or attempt
to repair any part of the exhaust system
until it has cooled. Use special care when
working around the catalytic converter.
The catalytic converter heats up to a very
high temperature after only a short
period of engine operation and stays hot
after the engine is switched off.
WARNING: Exhaust leaks may
result in entry of harmful and potentially
lethal fumes into the passenger
compartment. If you smell exhaust
fumes inside your vehicle, have your
vehicle inspected immediately. Do not
drive if you smell exhaust fumes.
Your vehicle has various emission control
components and a catalytic converter that
enables it to comply with applicable
exhaust emission standards.
To make sure that the catalytic converter
and other emission control components
continue to work properly:
•
Do not crank the engine for more than
10 seconds at a time.
•
Do not run the engine with a spark plug
lead disconnected.
•
Do not push-start or tow-start your
vehicle. Use booster cables.  See
Catalytic Converter (page 146).
•
Use only the specified fuel listed.
•
Do not switch the ignition off when your
vehicle is moving.
•
Avoid running out of fuel.
•
Have the items listed in scheduled
maintenance information performed
according to the specified schedule.
Note: Resulting component damage may
not be covered by the vehicle Warranty.
The scheduled maintenance items listed
in scheduled maintenance information are
essential to the life and performance of
your vehicle and to its emissions system.
If you use anything other than Ford,
Motorcraft or Ford-authorized parts for
maintenance replacements or for service
of components affecting emission control,
such non-Ford parts should be equivalent
to genuine Ford Motor Company parts in
performance and durability.

Engine Emission Control
Illumination of the service engine soon
indicator, charging system warning light or
the temperature warning light, fluid leaks,
strange odors, smoke or loss of engine
power could indicate that the emission
control system is not working properly.
An improperly operating or damaged
exhaust system may allow exhaust to
enter the vehicle. Have a damaged or
improperly operating exhaust system
inspected and repaired immediately.
Do not make any unauthorized changes to
your vehicle or engine. By law, vehicle
owners and anyone who manufactures,
repairs, services, sells, leases, trades
vehicles, or supervises a fleet of vehicles
are not permitted to intentionally remove
an emission control device or prevent it
from working. Information about your
vehicle’s emission system is on the Vehicle
Emission Control Information Decal
located on or near the engine. This decal
also lists engine displacement.
Please consult your warranty information
for complete details.
On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II)
Your vehicle has a computer known as the
on-board diagnostics system (OBD-II) that
monitors the engine’s emission control
system. The system protects the
environment by making sure that your
vehicle continues to meet government
emission standards. The OBD-II system
also assists a service technician in properly
servicing your vehicle.
When the service engine soon
indicator illuminates, the OBD-II
system has detected a
malfunction. Temporary malfunctions may
cause the service engine soon indicator to
illuminate. Examples are:
1.
Your vehicle has run out of fuel—the
engine may misfire or run poorly.
2.
Poor fuel quality or water in the
fuel—the engine may misfire or run
poorly.
3.
The fuel fill inlet may not have closed
properly.  See Refueling (page 141).
4.
Driving through deep water—the
electrical system may be wet.
You can correct these temporary
malfunctions by filling the fuel tank with
good quality fuel, properly closing the fuel
fill inlet or letting the electrical system dry
out. After three driving cycles without these
or any other temporary malfunctions
present, the service engine soon indicator
should stay off the next time you start the
engine. A driving cycle consists of a cold
engine startup followed by mixed city and
highway driving. No additional vehicle
service is required.
If the service engine soon indicator remains
on, have your vehicle serviced at the first
available opportunity. Although some
malfunctions detected by the OBD-II may
not have symptoms that are apparent,
continued driving with the service engine
soon indicator on can result in increased
emissions, lower fuel economy, reduced
engine and transmission smoothness and
lead to more costly repairs.
Readiness for Inspection and
Maintenance (I/M) Testing
Some state and provincial and local
governments may have
Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) programs
to inspect the emission control equipment
on your vehicle. Failure to pass this
inspection could prevent you from getting
a vehicle registration.
If the service engine soon
indicator is on or the bulb does
not work, your vehicle may need
service. See On-Board Diagnostics.
147

Engine Emission Control
Your vehicle may not pass the I/M test if
the service engine soon indicator is on or
not working properly (bulb is burned out),
or if the OBD-II system has determined
that some of the emission control systems
have not been properly checked. In this
case, the vehicle is not ready for I/M
testing.
If the vehicle’s engine or transmission has
just been serviced, or the battery has
recently run down or been replaced, the
OBD-II system may indicate that the
vehicle is not ready for I/M testing. To
determine if the vehicle is ready for I/M
testing, turn the ignition key to the on
position for 15 seconds without cranking
the engine. If the service engine soon
indicator blinks eight times, it means that
the vehicle is not ready for I/M testing; if
the service engine soon indicator stays on
solid, it means that your vehicle is ready
for I/M testing.
The OBD-II system checks the emission
control system during normal driving. A
complete check may take several days.
If the vehicle is not ready for I/M testing,
you can perform the following driving cycle
consisting of mixed city and highway
driving:
1.
15 minutes of steady driving on an
expressway or highway followed by 20
minutes of stop-and-go driving with at
least four 30-second idle periods.
2.
Allow your vehicle to sit for at least
eight hours with the ignition off. Then,
start the vehicle and complete the
above driving cycle. The vehicle must
warm up to its normal operating
temperature. Once started, do not turn
off the vehicle until the above driving
cycle is complete.
If the vehicle is still not ready for I/M
testing, you need to repeat the above
driving cycle.

appropriate gear for optimum performance
based on ambient temperature, road
gradient, vehicle load and your input.
Sport Mode (S)
Switch on sport mode by shifting the
gearshift lever to sport (S). In Sport mode
the transmission will select the optimum
gear for best performance. This gear
selection is typically lower than that of
drive (D) and the shifts are faster.

SelectShift™ Automatic
Transmission
This feature gives you the ability to change
gears up or down as desired.
Downshifts are allowed unless the engine
speed after the shift exceeds the
maximum allowable limit.
In order to prevent engine stalls,
SelectShift automatically downshifts at
low engine speeds.
Note: Engine damage may occur if you
maintain excessive engine revving without
shifting.
SelectShift does not automatically upshift,
even if the engine is approaching the RPM
limit, unless the accelerator pedal is at full
travel.
Take notice of the shift indicator lamp,
which alerts you when to shift to make sure
you achieve the highest level of efficiency
and fuel economy.

Emergency Park Position Release
Lever
Note: Do not drive your vehicle until you
verify that the brake lamps are working.
WARNING: When doing this
procedure, you need to take the
transmission out of park (P) which
means your vehicle can roll freely. To
avoid unwanted vehicle movement,
always fully apply the parking brake prior
to doing this procedure. Use wheels
chocks if appropriate.
WARNING: If the parking brake is
fully released, but the brake warning
lamp remains illuminated, the brakes
may not be working properly. Have your
vehicle checked as soon as possible.
Note: For some markets this feature will be
disabled.
Your vehicle is equipped with a brake-shift
interlock feature that prevents moving the
gearshift lever from park (P) when the
ignition is on and the brake pedal is not
pressed.
If you cannot move the transmission
selector lever out of park (P) position with
the ignition in the on position and the brake
pedal pressed, a malfunction may have
occurred. It is possible that a fuse has
blown or your vehicle’s brake lamps are
not operating properly. See Fuse
Specification Chart (page 203).
If the fuse is not blown and the brake
lamps are working properly, the following
procedure will allow you to move the
gearshift lever from park (P).
1.
Remove the shifter ring.
2.
Remove the climate control bezel
without removing the wiring harness.

Automatic Transmission Adaptive
Learning
This feature may increase durability and
provide consistent shift feel over the life
of your vehicle. A new vehicle or
transmission may have firm shifts, soft
shifts or both. This operation is considered
normal and does not affect function or
durability of the transmission. Over time,
the adaptive learning process fully updates
transmission operation.
If Your Vehicle Gets Stuck In Mud
or Snow
Note: Do not rock your vehicle if the engine
is not at normal operating temperature or
damage to the transmission may occur.
Note: Do not rock your vehicle for more
than a minute or damage to the
transmission and tires may occur, or the

USING FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE
Four-wheel drive uses all four wheels to
power the vehicle. This increases traction,
enabling you to drive over terrain and road
conditions that a conventional two-wheel
drive vehicle cannot. The 4WD system is
active all the time and requires no input
from the operator.
Note: Your 4WD vehicle is not intended for
off-road use. The 4WD feature gives your
vehicle some limited off-road capabilities
in which driving surfaces are relatively level,
obstruction-free and otherwise similar to
normal on-road driving conditions.
Operating your vehicle under other than
those conditions could subject the vehicle
to excessive stress which might result in
damage which is not covered under your
warranty.
Note: A warning message will be displayed
in the information display when an 4WD
system fault is present  See Information
Messages (page 96). An 4WD system fault
will cause the 4WD system to default to
front-wheel drive only mode. When this
warning message is displayed, have your
vehicle serviced at an authorized dealer
Note: A warning message will be displayed
in the information display if the 4WD system
has overheated  See Information
Messages (page 96).  This condition may
occur if the vehicle was operated in extreme
conditions with excessive wheel slip, such
as deep sand. To resume normal 4WD
function as soon as possible, stop the
vehicle in a safe location and stop the
engine for at least 10 minutes. After the
engine has been restarted and the 4WD
system has adequately cooled, the warning
message will turn off and normal 4WD
function will return.
Do not use a spare tire of a different size
other than the tire provided. If the
mini-spare tire is installed, the 4WD system
may disable automatically and enter
front-wheel drive only mode to protect
driveline components. This condition will
be indicated by a warning in the
information display  See Information
Messages (page 96).  If there is a warning
message in the information display from
using the spare tire, this indicator should
turn off after reinstalling the repaired or
replaced normal road tire and cycling the
ignition off and on. It is recommended to
reinstall the repaired or replaced road tire
as soon as possible. Major dissimilar tire
sizes between the front and rear axles
could cause the 4WD system to stop
functioning and default to front-wheel
drive or damage the 4WD system.
Driving In Special Conditions With
Four-Wheel Drive (4WD)
WARNING: If you are driving in
slippery conditions that require tire
chains or cables, then it is critical that
you drive cautiously. Keep speeds down,
allow for longer stopping distances and
avoid aggressive steering to reduce the
chances of a loss of vehicle control
which can lead to serious injury or death.
If the rear end of your vehicle slides while
cornering, steer in the direction of the
slide until you regain control of your
vehicle.
4WD vehicles are equipped for driving on
sand, snow, mud and rough roads and have
operating characteristics that are
somewhat different from conventional
vehicles, both on and off the highway.
Under severe operating conditions, the A/C
may cycle on and off to protect
overheating of the engine.

Four-Wheel Drive (If Equipped)
Basic operating principles in special
conditions
•
Drive slower in strong crosswinds which
can affect the normal steering
characteristics of your vehicle.
•
Be extremely careful when driving on
pavement made slippery by loose sand,
water, gravel, snow or ice.
If Your Vehicle Goes Off the Edge of the
Pavement
•
If your vehicle goes off the edge of the
pavement, slow down, but avoid severe
brake application, ease the vehicle
back onto the pavement only after
reducing your speed. Do not turn the
steering wheel too sharply while
returning to the road surface.
•
It may be safer to stay on the apron or
shoulder of the road and slow down
gradually before returning to the
pavement. You may lose control if you
do not slow down or if you turn the
steering wheel too sharply or abruptly.
•
It often may be less risky to strike small
objects, such as highway reflectors,
with minor damage to your vehicle
rather than attempt a sudden return to
the pavement which could cause the
vehicle to slide sideways out of control
or rollover. Remember, your safety and
the safety of others should be your
primary concern.
If Your Vehicle Gets Stuck
WARNING: Do not spin the wheels
at over 34 mph (55 km/h). The tires may
fail and injure a passenger or bystander.
Note: Do not rock the vehicle if the engine
is not at normal operating temperature or
damage to the transmission may occur.
Note: Do not rock the vehicle for more than
a few minutes or damage to the
transmission and tires may occur or the
engine may overheat.
If your vehicle gets stuck in mud or snow it
may be rocked out by shifting between
forward and reverse gears, stopping
between shifts, in a steady pattern. Press
lightly on the accelerator in each gear.
If your vehicle is equipped with
AdvanceTrac® with Roll Stability
Control™, it may be beneficial to
disengage the AdvanceTrac® with Roll
Stability Control™ system while
attempting to rock the vehicle.
Emergency Maneuvers
•
In an unavoidable emergency situation
where a sudden sharp turn must be
made, remember to avoid
"over-driving" your vehicle (i.e., turn the
steering wheel only as rapidly and as
far as required to avoid the
emergency). Excessive steering will
result in less vehicle control, not more.
Additionally, smooth variations of the
accelerator and/or brake pedal
pressure should be utilized if changes
in vehicle speed are called for. Avoid
abrupt steering, acceleration or braking
which could result in an increased risk
of loss of vehicle control, vehicle
rollover and/or personal injury. Use all
available road surface to return the
vehicle to a safe direction of travel.
•
In the event of an emergency stop,
avoid skidding the tires and do not
attempt any sharp steering wheel
movements.
•
If the vehicle goes from one type of
surface to another (i.e., from concrete
to gravel) there will be a change in the
way the vehicle responds to a
maneuver (steering, acceleration or
braking). Again, avoid these abrupt
inputs.

Four-Wheel Drive (If Equipped)
Sand
When driving over sand, try to keep all four
wheels on the most solid area of the trail.
Avoid reducing the tire pressures but shift
to a lower gear and drive steadily through
the terrain. Apply the accelerator slowly
and avoid spinning the wheels.
Do not drive your 4WD vehicle in deep
sand. This will cause the 4WD system to
overheat. After the system has cooled
down, normal 4WD function will return.
Under severe operating conditions, the A/C
may cycle on and off to protect
overheating of the engine.
Avoid excessive speed because vehicle
momentum can work against you and
cause the vehicle to become stuck to the
point that assistance may be required from
another vehicle. Remember, you may be
able to back out the way you came if you
proceed with caution.
Mud and Water
If you must drive through high water, drive
slowly. Traction or brake capability may
be limited.
When driving through water, determine the
depth; avoid water higher than the bottom
of the wheel rims (for cars) or the bottom
of the hubs (for trucks) (if possible) and
proceed slowly. If the ignition system gets
wet, the vehicle may stall.
Once through water, always try the brakes.
Wet brakes do not stop the vehicle as
effectively as dry brakes. Drying can be
improved by moving your vehicle slowly
while applying light pressure on the brake
pedal.
Be cautious of sudden changes in vehicle
speed or direction when you are driving in
mud. Even 4WD vehicles can lose traction
in slick mud. As when you are driving over
sand, apply the accelerator slowly and
avoid spinning your wheels. If the vehicle
does slide, steer in the direction of the slide
until you regain control of the vehicle.
After driving through mud, clean off residue
stuck to rotating driveshafts and tires.
Excess mud stuck on tires and rotating
driveshafts causes an imbalance that
could damage drive components.
Note: Driving through deep water may
damage the transmission.
If the front or rear axle is submerged in
water, the axle lubricant and 4WD PTU
(Power Transfer Unit) lubricant should be
checked and changed if necessary.
Driving on Hilly or Sloping Terrain
Note:  Avoid driving crosswise or turning on
steep slopes or hills.  A danger lies in losing
traction, slipping sideways and possibly
rolling over.  Whenever driving on a hill,
determine beforehand the route you will
use.  Do not drive over the crest of a hill
without seeing what conditions are on the
other side.  Do not drive in reverse over a hill
without the aid of an observer.
Whenever driving on a hill, determine

Four-Wheel Drive (If Equipped)
Although natural obstacles may make it
necessary to travel diagonally up or down
a hill or steep incline, you should always
try to drive straight up or straight down.
When climbing a steep slope or hill, start
in a lower gear rather than downshifting to
a lower gear from a higher gear once the
ascent has started. This reduces strain on
the engine and the possibility of stalling.
If you do stall out, do not try to turnaround
because you might roll over. It is better to
back down to a safe location.
Apply just enough power to the wheels to
climb the hill. Too much power will cause
the tires to slip, spin or lose traction,
resulting in loss of vehicle control.
Descend a hill in the same gear you would
use to climb up the hill to avoid excessive
brake application and brake overheating.
Do not descend in neutral; instead,
disengage overdrive or manually shift to a
lower gear. When descending a steep hill,
avoid sudden hard braking as you could
lose control. The front wheels have to be
turning in order to steer the vehicle.
Your vehicle has anti-lock brakes, therefore
apply the brakes steadily. Do not “pump”
the brakes.
Maintenance and Modifications
The suspension and steering systems on
your vehicle have been designed and
tested to provide predictable performance
whether loaded or empty and durable load
carrying capability. For this reason, Ford
Motor Company strongly recommends that
you do not make modifications such as
adding or removing parts (such as lowering
kits or stabilizer bars) or by using
replacement parts not equivalent to the
original factory equipment.
Any modifications to a vehicle that raise
the center of gravity can make it more likely
the vehicle will rollover as a result of a loss
of control. Ford Motor Company
recommends that caution be used with
any vehicle equipped with a high load or
device (such as ladder or luggage racks).
Failure to maintain your vehicle properly
may void the warranty, increase your repair
cost, reduce vehicle performance and
operational capabilities and adversely
affect driver and passenger safety.
Frequent inspection of vehicle chassis
components is recommended if the vehicle
is subjected to off-highway usage.

Four-Wheel Drive (If Equipped)
GENERAL INFORMATION
Wet brakes result in reduced braking
efficiency.  Gently press the brake pedal a
few times when driving from a car wash or
standing water to dry the brakes.
Brake Over Accelerator
In the event the accelerator pedal
becomes stuck or entrapped, apply steady
and firm pressure to the brake pedal to
slow the vehicle and reduce engine power.
If you experience this condition, apply the
brakes and bring your vehicle to a safe
stop.  Shift the transmission to park (P)
(automatic transmission) or to a low gear
(manual transmission), switch the engine
off and apply the parking brake.
Check the accelerator pedal and the area
around it for any items or debris that may
be obstructing its movement.  If none are
found and the condition persists, have your
vehicle towed to the dealer for service.
Emergency Brake Assist
Emergency brake assist detects when you
brake heavily by measuring the rate at
which you press the brake pedal.  It
provides maximum braking efficiency as
long as you press the pedal.  Emergency
brake assist can reduce stopping distances
in critical situations.
Anti-lock Brake System
This system helps you maintain steering
control and vehicle stability during
emergency stops by keeping the brakes
from locking.
It illuminates when you switch
the ignition on.  If the light does
not illuminate during start up,
remains on or flashes, the system may be
disabled.  Have the system checked by an
authorized dealer.  If the anti-lock brake
system is disabled, normal braking is still
effective.
If the brake warning lamp
illuminates when you release the
parking brake, have the system
checked by an authorized dealer. This lamp
also illuminates momentarily when you
switch the ignition on to confirm the lamp
is functional. If it does not illuminate when
you switch the ignition on, or begins to
flash at any time, have the system checked
by an authorized dealer.
Note:  Occasional brake noise is normal.  If
a metal-to-metal, continuous grinding or
continuous squeal sound is present, the
brake linings may be worn-out.  If your
vehicle has continuous vibration or shudder
in the steering wheel while braking, have
your vehicle checked by an authorized
dealer.
Note:  Brake dust may accumulate on the
wheels, even under normal driving
conditions.  Some dust is inevitable as the
brakes wear.  See Cleaning the Wheels
(page 244).
Note: Depending on applicable laws and
regulations in the country for which your
vehicle was originally built, the brake lamps
may flash during heavy braking. Following
this the hazard warning flashers may also
flash when your vehicle comes to a stop.
See Warning Lamps and
Indicators (page 89).

HINTS ON DRIVING WITH
ANTI-LOCK BRAKES
The anti-lock braking system does not
eliminate the risks when:
•
You drive too closely to the vehicle in
front of you.
•
Your vehicle is hydroplaning.
•
You take corners too fast.
•
The road surface is poor.
Note:  If the system activates, the brake
pedal may pulse and may travel further.
Maintain pressure on the brake pedal.  You
may also hear a noise from the system.  This
is normal.

Brakes
The system makes it easier to pull away
when your vehicle is on a slope without the
need to use the parking brake.
When the system activates, your vehicle
remains stationary on a slope for a few
seconds after you release the brake pedal.
This allows you time to move your foot
from the brake to the accelerator pedal.
The brakes release when the engine has
developed sufficient torque to prevent your
vehicle from rolling down the slope. This
is an advantage when pulling away on a
slope, for example from a car park ramp,
traffic lights or when reversing uphill into
a parking space.
The system activates on any slope that
causes your vehicle to roll.
Note: There is no warning lamp to indicate
the system is either on or off.
Using Hill Start Assist
1.
Press the brake pedal to bring your
vehicle to a complete standstill. Keep
the brake pedal pressed and shift into
first gear when facing uphill or reverse
(R) when facing downhill.
2.
The system activates if the sensors
detect that your vehicle is on a slope.
3.
When you remove your foot from the
brake pedal, your vehicle remains on
the slope without rolling away for a few
seconds. This hold time increases if you
are in the process of driving off.
4.
Pull away in the normal manner.

Brakes
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
The traction control system helps avoid
drive wheel spin and loss of traction.
If your vehicle begins to slide, the system
applies the brakes to individual wheels
and, when needed, reduces engine power
at the same time. If the wheels spin when
accelerating on slippery or loose surfaces,
the system reduces engine power in order
to increase traction.
USING TRACTION CONTROL
In certain situations for example, stuck in
snow or mud, turning the traction control
off may be beneficial as this allows the
wheels to spin with full engine power.
Depending on the type of system you have
on your vehicle, you can either turn the
system off using the information display
or by pressing the button.
Switching the System Off Using
the Information Display Controls
(If Equipped)
Your vehicle comes with this feature
already enabled. If required, you can switch
this feature off using the information

The button is located in the instrument
panel.
Press the button. You will see a message
in conjunction with an illuminated icon in
the display. Press the button again to
return the system to normal mode.
When you switch the traction control
system off, stability control remains fully

If the stability control light still
illuminates steadily, have the system
serviced by an authorized dealer
immediately. Operating your vehicle with
AdvanceTrac disabled could lead to an
increased risk of loss of vehicle control,
vehicle rollover, personal injury and
death.
The stability control light

Traction Control (If Equipped)
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
Electronic Stability Control
WARNING: The system is
designed to aid the driver. It is not
intended to replace your attention and
judgment. You are still responsible to
drive with due care and attention.
The system supports stability when your
vehicle starts to slide away from your
intended path. The system does this by
braking individual wheels and reducing
engine torque.
The system also provides an enhanced
traction control function by reducing
engine torque if the wheels spin when you
accelerate. This helps to pull away on
slippery roads or loose surfaces, and
improves comfort by limiting wheel spin in
hairpin bends.

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
WARNING: The system may not
detect objects with surfaces that absorb
reflection. Always drive with due care
and attention. Failure to take care may
result in a crash.
WARNING: To help avoid personal
injury, always use caution when in
reverse (R) and when using the sensing
system.
WARNING: The system may not
detect small or moving objects,
particularly those close to the ground.
Note: Certain add-on devices installed
around the rear fascia such as large trailer
hitches, bike or surfboard racks or certain
add-on devices installed around the front
fascia such as license plate brackets or
frames, bumper covers, bumper guards or
any other device that may block the normal
detection zone of the system, may create
false beeps.
Note: In these cases the add-on devices
must be removed in order to prevent the
false beeps.
Note:  Keep the sensors free from snow, ice
and large accumulations of dirt.  Blocked
sensors may affect system accuracy.  Do
not clean the sensors with sharp objects.
Note: If your vehicle sustains damage to
the bumper or fascia, leaving it misaligned
or bent, the sensing zone may be altered
causing inaccurate measurement of
obstacles or false alarms.
Note: When a trailer is connected to the
vehicle, the Rear Sensing System may
detect the trailer and therefore provide
warnings. It is suggested that the driver
disables the Rear Sensing System when a
trailer is connected to the vehicle to prevent
these warnings.
We recommend that you take some time
to get to know the system and its
limitations by reading this section.
The sensing system warns the driver of
obstacles within a certain range of your
vehicle.  The system automatically turns
on each time you switch the ignition on.
The system may provide display or sound
warnings when the detected obstacle is
12 in (30 cm) or less from the bumper.
The system can be switched off through
the information display menu or from the
pop-up message that appears once you
shift the transmission into reverse (R). If
your vehicle is equipped with a front
sensing system, you can switch the system
off using the parking aid button. See
General Information (page 93).
If a fault is present in the system, a warning

11.81 in (30 cm) the warning sounds
continuously. If the system detects an
object farther than 11.81 in (30 cm) from
the corners of the bumper, the tone sounds
for only three seconds. If the system
detects an approaching object the warning
sounds again.
Coverage area of up to 6 ft (1.8 m) from
the rear bumper. There is decreased
coverage area at the outer corners of the
bumper.
The system detects certain objects while
the transmission is in reverse (R):
•
Moving toward a stationary object at
a speed of 3 mph (5 km/h) or less.
•
Not moving, but a moving object is
approaching the rear of your vehicle at
a speed of 3 mph (5 km/h) or less.
•
Moving at a speed of less than 3 mph
(5 km/h) and a moving object is
approaching the rear of your vehicle at
a speed of less than 3 mph (5 km/h).
The system provides audio warnings
only when your vehicle is moving or
when your vehicle is stationary and the
detected obstacle is less than 10 in
(30 cm) away from the bumper.
Additionally, the system provides
obstacle distance indication through
the center stack display (if equipped).
The visual indications are present when
the transmission is in reverse (R).
•
As the distance to the obstacle
decreases (obstacle becomes closer),
the indicator blocks illuminate and
move towards the vehicle icon.
•
If there is no obstacle detected, the
distance indicator blocks show greyed
out.
REAR VIEW CAMERA
WARNING: The rear view camera
system is a reverse aid supplement
device that still requires the driver to use
it in conjunction with the interior and
exterior mirrors for maximum coverage.
WARNING: Use caution when the
rear cargo door is ajar. If the rear cargo
door is ajar, the camera will be out of
position and the video image may be
incorrect. All guidelines disappear when
the rear cargo door is ajar. Failure to
follow this instruction could result in
personal injury.
WARNING: Objects that are close
to either corner of the bumper or under
the bumper, might not be seen on the
screen due to the limited coverage of the
camera system.
WARNING: Reverse your vehicle
slowly. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in the loss of control of your
vehicle, personal injury or death.

WARNING: Use caution when
turning camera features on or off when
the transmission is not in park (P). Make
sure your vehicle is not moving.
The rear view camera system provides a
video image of the area behind your
vehicle.
During operation, lines appear in the
display which represent your vehicle’s path
and proximity to objects behind your
vehicle.
•
Vehicles without spare wheel: camera
is located on swing gate applique.
•
Vehicles with spare wheel: camera is
mounted to the spare wheel bracket.
Using the Rear View Camera
System
The rear view camera system displays
what is behind your vehicle when you place
the transmission in reverse (R).
The system uses three types of guides to
help you see what is behind your vehicle:
•
Active guidelines: Show the intended
path of your vehicle when reversing.
•
Fixed guidelines: Show the actual path
your vehicle is moving in while reversing
in a straight line. This can be helpful
when backing into a parking space or
aligning your vehicle with another
object behind you.
•
Centerline: Helps align the center of
your vehicle with an object (for
example, a trailer).
Note: If the transmission is in reverse (R)
and the luggage compartment is ajar, no
rear view camera features are displayed.
Note: If the image comes on while the
transmission is not in reverse (R), have the
system checked as soon as possible.
Note: When towing, the camera only sees
what is being towed behind your vehicle.
This might not provide adequate coverage
as it usually provides in normal operation
and some objects might not be seen. In
some vehicles, the guidelines may disappear
once the trailer tow connector is engaged.
Note: The camera may not operate
correctly under the following conditions:
•
Nighttime or dark areas if one or both
reverse lamps are not operating.
•
The camera's view is obstructed by
mud, water or debris.  Clean the lens
with a soft, lint-free cloth and
non-abrasive cleaner.
•
The rear of your vehicle is hit or
damaged, causing the camera to
become misaligned.
Access the rear view camera system
settings through the information display.
See General Information (page 93).
After changing a system setting, the

STEERING
Electric Power Steering
WARNING: The electric power
steering system has diagnostic checks
that continuously monitor the system. If
a fault is detected, a message displays
in the information display. Stop your
vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so.
Switch the ignition off. After at least 10
seconds, switch the ignition on and
watch the information display for a
steering system warning message. If a
steering system warning message
returns, have the system checked as
soon as possible.
WARNING: If the system detects
an error, you may not feel a difference in
the steering, however a serious condition
may exist. Have your vehicle checked as
soon as possible, failure to do so may
result in loss of steering control.
Note: Your vehicle is equipped with an
electric power-assisted steering system.
There is no fluid reservoir to check or fill.
The electric power steering system
operates by an electric motor, which
reduces the effort on the driver's steering
wheel.
The system operates progressively and
during maneuvers, the system leaves the
effort lighter. As the vehicle speed
increases, it reduces its action to improve
the control of the vehicle.
If your vehicle loses electrical power while
you are driving (or if the ignition is turned
off), you can steer the vehicle manually,
but it takes more effort. Extreme
continuous steering may increase the effort
it takes for you to steer. This occurs to
prevent internal overheating and
permanent damage to your steering
system. If this should occur, you will not
lose the ability to steer the vehicle
manually nor will it cause permanent
damage. Typical steering and driving
maneuvers will allow the system to cool
and steering assist will return to normal.
Steering Tips
Avoid sudden movements with the steering
wheel. The force required to change the
vehicle direction is lower, compared to a
vehicle with mechanical steering.
If the steering wanders or pulls, check for:
•
An improperly inflated tire
•
Uneven tire wear
•
Loose or worn suspension components
•
Loose or worn steering components
•
Improper vehicle alignment
A high crown in the road or high crosswinds
may also make the steering seem to
wander or pull.

Note:  Loads should never be placed
directly on the roof panel.
The roof panel is not designed to directly
carry a load.
For proper function of the roof rack system,
loads must be placed directly on crossbars
affixed to the roof rack side rails. Your
vehicle may be equipped with
factory-installed crossbars. Ford Genuine
Accessory crossbars, designed specifically
for your vehicle, are also recommended for
use with your roof rack system.
Make sure that the load is securely
fastened.  Check the tightness of the load
before driving and at each fuel stop.
Adjusting the Crossbar (If Equipped)
Note: Wind noise can be minimized by
either removing or repositioning the crossbar
when not is use. Position the front crossbar
in the intermediate position to minimize
wind noise. The crossbar can be adjusted
or removed using the steps below.

LOAD LIMIT
Vehicle Loading - with and
without a Trailer
This section guides you in the
proper loading of your vehicle,
trailer, or both. Keep your loaded
vehicle weight within its design
rating capability, with or without
a trailer. Properly loading your
vehicle provides maximum return
of vehicle design performance.
Before you load your vehicle,
become familiar with the
following terms for determining
your vehicle’s weight rating, with
or without a trailer, from the
vehicle’s Tire and Loading
Information label or Safety
Compliance Certification label.
Tire and Loading Label Information
Example:
Payload
Payload is the combined weight
of cargo and passengers that your
vehicle is carrying. The maximum
payload for your vehicle appears
on the Tire and Loading label. The
label is either on the B-pillar or the
176
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Load Carrying
edge of the driver door. Vehicles
exported outside the US and
Canada may not have a tire and
loading label. Look for “The
combined weight of occupants
and cargo should never exceed
XXX kg OR XXX lb” for maximum
payload. The payload listed on the
Tire and Loading Information label
is the maximum payload for your
vehicle as built by the assembly
plant. If you install any additional
equipment on your vehicle, you
must determine the new payload.
Subtract the weight of the
equipment from the payload listed
on the Tire and Loading label.
When towing, trailer tongue
weight or king pin weight is also
part of payload.
WARNING: The
appropriate loading capacity of
your vehicle can be limited either
by volume capacity (how much
space is available) or by payload
capacity (how much weight the
vehicle should carry). Once you
have reached the maximum
payload of your vehicle, do not
add more cargo, even if there is
space available. Overloading or
improperly loading your vehicle
can contribute to loss of vehicle
control and vehicle rollover.
GAWR (Gross Axle Weight
Rating)
GAWR is the maximum allowable
weight that a single axle (front or
rear) can carry. These numbers
are on the Safety Compliance
Certification label. The label is
located on the door hinge pillar,
door-latch post, or the door edge
that meets the door-latch post,
next to the driver seating position.
The total load on each axle must
never exceed its Gross Axle
Weight Rating.
GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight
Rating)
GVWR is the maximum allowable
weight of the fully loaded vehicle.
This includes all options,
equipment, passengers and cargo.
It appears on the Safety
Compliance Certification label.
The label is located on the door
hinge pillar, door-latch post, or the
door edge that meets the
door-latch post, next to the driver
seating position.
The gross vehicle weight must
never exceed the Gross Vehicle
Weight Rating.

Load Carrying
Safety Compliance Certification Label
Example:
WARNING: Exceeding the
Safety Compliance Certification
label vehicle weight limits can
adversely affect the
performance and handling of
your vehicle, cause vehicle
damage and can result in the
loss of control of your vehicle,
serious personal injury or death.
Maximum Loaded Trailer
Weight
Maximum loaded trailer weight is
the highest possible weight of a
fully loaded trailer the vehicle can
tow. Consult an authorized dealer
(or the RV and Trailer Towing
Guide available at an authorized
dealer) for more detailed
information.
GCWR (Gross Combined
Weight Rating)
GCWR is the maximum allowable
weight of the vehicle and the
loaded trailer, including all cargo
and passengers, that the vehicle
can handle without risking
damage. (Important: The towing
vehicle’s braking system is rated
for operation at Gross Vehicle
Weight Rating, not at Gross
Combined Weight Rating.)
Separate functional brakes should
be used for safe control of towed
vehicles and for trailers where the
Gross Combined Weight of the
towing vehicle plus the trailer
exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight
Rating of the towing vehicle.
The gross combined weight must
never exceed the Gross Combined
Weight Rating.
Note:  For trailer towing
information refer to the RV and
Trailer Towing Guide available at
an authorized dealer.
WARNING: Do not exceed
the GVWR or the GAWR
specified on the certification
label.
WARNING: Do not use
replacement tires with lower
load carrying capacities than the
original tires because they may
lower your vehicle's GVWR and
GAWR limitations. Replacement
tires with a higher limit than the
original tires do not increase the
GVWR and GAWR limitations.

Load Carrying
WARNING: Exceeding any
vehicle weight rating can
adversely affect the
performance and handling of
your vehicle, cause vehicle
damage and can result in the
loss of control of your vehicle,
serious personal injury or death.
Steps for determining the
correct load limit:
1. Locate the statement "The
combined weight of occupants
and cargo should never exceed
XXX kg or XXX lb." on your
vehicle’s placard.
2. Determine the combined
weight of the driver and
passengers that will be riding
in your vehicle.
3. Subtract the combined weight
of the driver and passengers
from XXX kg or XXX lb.
4. The resulting figure equals the
available amount of cargo and
luggage load capacity. For
example, if the “XXX” amount
equals 1,400 lb. and there will
be five 150 lb. passengers in
your vehicle, the amount of
available cargo and luggage
load capacity is 650 lb.
(1400-750 (5 x 150) = 650 lb.)
5. Determine the combined
weight of luggage and cargo
being loaded on the vehicle.
That weight may not safely
exceed the available cargo and
luggage load capacity
calculated in Step 4.
6. If your vehicle will be towing a
trailer, load from your trailer
will be transferred to your
vehicle. Consult this manual to
determine how this reduces the
available cargo and luggage
load capacity of your vehicle.
Helpful examples for calculating
the available amount of cargo
and luggage load capacity
Suppose your vehicle has a
1400-pound (635-kilogram) cargo
and luggage capacity. You decide
to go golfing. Is there enough load
capacity to carry you, four of your
friends and all the golf bags? You
and four friends average 220
pounds (99 kilograms) each and
the golf bags weigh approximately
30 pounds (13.5 kilograms) each.
The calculation would be: 1400 -
(5 x 220) - (5 x 30) = 1400 - 1100
- 150 = 150 pounds. Yes, you have
enough load capacity in your
vehicle to transport four friends
and your golf bags. In metric units,
the calculation would be: 635
kilograms - (5 x 99 kilograms) -
(5 x 13.5 kilograms) = 635 - 495 -
67.5 = 72.5 kilograms.

Load Carrying
Suppose your vehicle has a
1400-pound (635-kilogram) cargo
and luggage capacity. You and
one of your friends decide to pick
up cement from the local home
improvement store to finish that
patio you have been planning for
the past two years. Measuring the
inside of the vehicle with the rear
seat folded down, you have room
for twelve 100-pound
(45-kilogram) bags of cement. Do
you have enough load capacity to
transport the cement to your
home? If you and your friend each
weigh 220 pounds (99 kilograms),
the calculation would be: 1400 -
(2 x 220) - (12 x 100) = 1400 - 440
- 1200 = - 240 pounds. No, you do
not have enough cargo capacity
to carry that much weight. In
metric units, the calculation would
be: 635 kilograms - (2 x 99
kilograms) - (12 x 45 kilograms) =
635 - 198 - 540 = -103 kilograms.
You will need to reduce the load
weight by at least 240 pounds
(104 kilograms). If you remove
three 100-pound (45-kilogram)
cement bags, then the load
calculation would be:1400 - (2 x
220) - (9 x 100) = 1400 - 440 -
900 = 60 pounds. Now you have
the load capacity to transport the
cement and your friend home. In
metric units, the calculation would
be: 635 kilograms - (2 x 99
kilograms) - (9 x 45 kilograms) =
635 - 198 - 405 = 32 kilograms.
The above calculations also
assume that the loads are
positioned in your vehicle in a
manner that does not overload
the front or the rear gross axle
weight rating specified for your
vehicle on the Safety Compliance
Certification label.
Special Loading Instructions
for Owners of Pick-up Trucks
and Utility-type Vehicles
WARNING: When loading
the roof racks, we recommend
you evenly distribute the load,
as well as maintain a low center
of gravity. Loaded vehicles, with
higher centers of gravity, may
handle differently than unloaded
vehicles. Take extra precautions,
such as slower speeds and
increased stopping distance,
when driving a heavily loaded
vehicle.

TOWING A TRAILER
WARNING: Towing trailers beyond
the maximum recommended gross
trailer weight exceeds the limit of your
vehicle and could result in engine
damage, transmission damage,
structural damage, loss of vehicle
control, vehicle rollover and personal
injury.
WARNING: Do not exceed the
GVWR or the GAWR specified on the
certification label.
Note:  See Towing a Trailer (page 181).
Your vehicle may have electrical items,
such as fuses or relays, related to towing.
See Fuses (page 203).
Your vehicle's load capacity designation
is by weight, not by volume, so you cannot
necessarily use all available space when
loading a vehicle or trailer.
Towing a trailer places an extra load on
your vehicle's engine, transmission, axle,
brakes, tires and suspension. Inspect these
components periodically during, and after,
any towing operation.
Load Placement
To help minimize how trailer movement
affects your vehicle when driving:
•
Load the heaviest items closest to the
trailer floor.
•
Load the heaviest items centered
between the left and right side trailer
tires.
•
Load the heaviest items above the
trailer axles or just slightly forward
toward the trailer tongue. Do not allow
the final trailer tongue weight to go
above or below 10-15% of the loaded
trailer weight.
•
Select a ball mount with the correct
rise or drop and load capacity. When
both the loaded vehicle and trailer are
connected, the trailer frame should be
level, or slightly angled down toward
your vehicle, when viewed from the
side.
When driving with a trailer or payload, a
slight takeoff vibration or shudder may be
present due to the increased payload
weight. Additional information regarding
proper trailer loading and setting your
vehicle up for towing is located in another
chapter of this manual.  See Load Limit
(page 176).
You can also find information in the RV &
Trailer Towing Guide available at your
authorized dealer, or online.

TRAILER SWAY CONTROL
Note: This feature does not prevent trailer
sway, but reduces it once it begins.
Note: This feature cannot stop all trailers
from swaying.
Note: In some cases, if your vehicle speed
is too high, the system may turn on multiple
times, gradually reducing your vehicle speed.

This feature applies your vehicle brakes at
individual wheels and if necessary, reduces
engine power. If the trailer begins to sway,
the traction control warning lamp flashes
and a message will appear in the
information display. Slow your vehicle
down, pull safely to the side of the road
and check for correct load distribution.
See Load Carrying (page 174).
RECOMMENDED TOWING
WEIGHTS
Note: Do not exceed the trailer
weight for your vehicle
configuration listed in the chart
below.
Note: For high altitude operation,
reduce the gross combined weight
by 2% per 1000 feet (300 meters)
starting at the 1000 foot (300
meter) elevation point.
Note: Certain states require
electric trailer brakes for trailers
over a specified weight. Be sure to
check state regulations for this
specified weight. The maximum
trailer weights listed may be limited
to this specified weight, as the
vehicle’s electrical system may not
include the wiring connector
needed to activate electric trailer
brakes.

ESSENTIAL TOWING CHECKS
Follow these guidelines for safe towing:
•
Do not tow a trailer until you drive your
vehicle at least 1,000 mi (1,600 km).
•
Consult your local motor vehicle laws
for towing a trailer.
•
See the instructions included with
towing accessories for the proper
installation and adjustment
specifications.
•
Service your vehicle more frequently if
you tow a trailer. See your scheduled
maintenance information.
•
If you use a rental trailer, follow the
instructions the rental agency gives
you.
You can find information on load
specification terms found on the tire label
and Safety Compliance label as well as
instructions on calculating your vehicle's
load in the Load Carrying chapter.  See
Load Limit (page 176).
Remember to account for the trailer
tongue weight as part of your vehicle load
when calculating the total vehicle weight.
Trailer Towing Connector (If Equipped)
When attaching the trailer wiring connector
to your vehicle, only use a proper fitting
connector that works with the vehicle and
trailer functions.
Note: Install the water proof protection cap
back onto the trailer towing connector
whenever it is not in use. This helps to
prevent water damage and trailer towing
connector malfunction.
Note: You cannot use a seven-pin trailer
wiring connector for your vehicle and the
trailer lighting equipment.

Safety Chains
Note: Never attach safety chains to the
bumper.
Always connect the safety chains to the
hook retainers of your vehicle hitch.
To connect the trailer’s safety chains, cross
them under the trailer tongue and allow
enough slack for turning tight corners. Do
not allow the chains to drag on the ground.

Towing
Trailer Brakes
WARNING: Do not connect a
trailer's hydraulic brake system directly
to your vehicle's brake system. Your
vehicle may not have enough braking
power and your chances of having a
collision greatly increase.
Electric brakes and manual, automatic or
surge-type trailer brakes are safe if you
install them properly and adjust them to
the manufacturer's specifications. The
trailer brakes must meet local and federal
regulations.
The rating for the tow vehicle's braking
system operation is at the gross vehicle
weight rating, not the gross combined
weight rating.
Separate functioning brake systems
are required for safe control of towed
vehicles and trailers weighing more
than 1500 lb (680 kg) when loaded.
Trailer Lamps
WARNING: Never connect any
trailer lamp wiring to the vehicle's tail
lamp wiring; this may damage the
electrical system resulting in fire. Contact
your authorized dealer as soon as
possible for assistance in proper trailer
tow wiring installation. Additional
electrical equipment may be required.
Trailer lamps are required on most towed
vehicles. Make sure all running lights, brake
lights, turn signals and hazard lights are
working.
Before Towing a Trailer
Practice turning, stopping and backing up
to get the feel of your vehicle-trailer
combination before starting on a trip.
When turning, make wider turns so the
trailer wheels clear curbs and other
obstacles.
When Towing a Trailer
•
Do not drive faster than 70 mph
(113 km/h) during the first 500 mi
(800 km).
•
Do not make full-throttle starts.
•
Check your hitch, electrical connections
and trailer wheel lug nuts thoroughly
after you have traveled 50 mi (80 km).
•
When stopped in congested or heavy
traffic during hot weather, place the
transmission in park (P) to aid engine
and transmission cooling and to help
A/C performance.
•
Turn off the speed control with heavy
loads or in hilly terrain. The speed
control may turn off automatically
when you are towing on long, steep
grades.
•
Shift to a lower gear when driving down
a long or steep hill. Do not apply the
brakes continuously, as they may
overheat and become less effective.
•
If your transmission is equipped with a
Grade Assist or Tow/Haul feature, use
this feature when towing. This provides
engine braking and helps eliminate
excessive transmission shifting for
optimum fuel economy and
transmission cooling.
•
Allow more distance for stopping with
a trailer attached. Anticipate stops and
brake gradually.
•
Avoid parking on a grade. However, if
you must park on a grade:
1.
Turn the steering wheel to point your
vehicle tires away from traffic flow.
184

Towing
2.
Set your vehicle parking brake.
3.
Place the automatic transmission in
park (P).
4.
Place wheel chocks in front and back
of the trailer wheels. Chocks are not
included with your vehicle.
Launching or Retrieving a Boat or
Personal Watercraft (PWC)
Note: Disconnect the wiring to the trailer
before backing the trailer into the water.
Note: Reconnect the wiring to the trailer
after removing the trailer from the water.
When backing down a ramp during boat
launching or retrieval:
•
Do not allow the static water level to
rise above the bottom edge of the rear
bumper.
•
Do not allow waves to break higher
than 6 in (15 cm) above the bottom
edge of the rear bumper.
Exceeding these limits may allow water to
enter vehicle components:
•
Causing internal damage to the
components.
•
Affecting driveability, emissions, and
reliability.
Replace the rear axle lubricant anytime
the rear axle has been submerged in water.
Water may have contaminated the rear
axle lubricant, which is not normally
checked or changed unless a leak is
suspected or other axle repair is required.

Note: The recovery hook has a left-hand
thread. Turn it counterclockwise to install it
and make sure that it is fully tightened.
Failure to do so could result in the recovery
hook becoming loose.
Note: If your vehicle has a tow bar, use this
to tow other vehicles.
TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE
If you need to have your vehicle towed,
contact a professional towing service or,
if you are a member of a roadside
assistance program, your roadside
assistance service provider.
We recommend towing your vehicle with
a wheel lift and dollies or flatbed
equipment. Do not tow with a slingbelt.
Ford Motor Company has not approved a
slingbelt towing procedure.
It is acceptable to tow a front-wheel drive
vehicle from the front if using proper wheel
lift equipment to raise the front wheels off
the ground. When towing in this manner,
the rear wheels can remain on the ground.
186
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Towing
Front-wheel drive vehicles must have the
front wheels placed on a two-wheel tow
dolly when towing your vehicle from the
rear using wheel lift equipment. This
prevents damage to the transmission.
Towing a four-wheel drive vehicle requires
that all wheels be off the ground, such as
using a wheel lift and dollies or flatbed
equipment. This prevents damage to the
transmission, four-wheel drive system and
vehicle.
TOWING THE VEHICLE ON
FOUR WHEELS
Emergency Towing
If your vehicle becomes inoperable
(without access to wheel dollies,
car-hauling trailer, or flatbed transport
vehicle), it can be flat-towed (all wheels
on the ground, regardless of the powertrain
and transmission configuration) under the
following conditions:
•
Your vehicle is facing forward for
towing in a forward direction.
•
Place the transmission in position N. If
you cannot move the transmission into
N, you may need to override it.  See
Transmission (page 149).
•
Maximum speed is 35 mph (56 km/h).
•
Maximum distance is 50 mi (80 km).
WARNING: If your vehicle has a
steering wheel lock make sure the
ignition is in the accessory or on position
when being towed.
Recreational Towing
Note: Put your climate control system in
recirculated air mode to prevent exhaust
fumes from entering the vehicle.  See
Climate Control (page 106).
Follow these guidelines if you have a need
for recreational (RV) towing. An example
of recreational towing would be towing
your vehicle behind a motorhome. We
designed these guidelines to prevent
damage to your transmission.
Front-wheel drive vehicles CANNOT be
flat-towed (all wheels on the ground) as
vehicle or transmission damage may occur.
You must place the front wheels on a
two-wheel tow dolly. If you are using a tow
dolly, follow the instructions specified by
the equipment provider.
Four-wheel drive vehicles CANNOT be
flat-towed (all wheels on the ground), as
vehicle or transmission damage may occur.
It is recommended to tow your vehicle with
all four (4) wheels off the ground such as
when using a car-hauling trailer. Otherwise,
you cannot recreational tow your vehicle.

BREAKING-IN
Tires
Note: New tires need to be run-in for
approximately 310.7 mi (500 km). During
this time, you may experience different
driving characteristics.
Brakes and Clutch
Note: If possible, avoid heavy braking and
clutching during the first 93.2 mi (150 km)
in the city, and the first 932.1 mi (1,500 km)
in highways.
ECONOMICAL DRIVING
Fuel economy is affected by several things
such as how you drive, the conditions you
drive under and how you maintain your
vehicle.
There are some things to keep in mind that
may improve your fuel economy:
•
Accelerate and slow down in a smooth,
moderate fashion.
•
Drive at steady speeds.
•
Anticipate stops; slowing down may
eliminate the need to stop.
•
Combine errands and minimize
stop-and-go driving (When running
errands, go to the furthest destination
first and then work your way back
home).
•
Close the windows for high-speed
driving.
•
Drive at reasonable speeds.
•
Keep the tires properly inflated and use
only the recommended size.
•
Use the recommended engine oil.
•
Perform all regularly scheduled
maintenance.
There are also some things you may want
to avoid doing because they reduce your
fuel economy:
•
Avoid sudden or hard accelerations.
•
Avoid revving the engine before turning
off the car.
•
Avoid long idle periods.
•
Do not warm up your vehicle on cold
mornings.
•
Reduce the use of air conditioning and
heat.
•
Avoid using speed control in hilly
terrain.
•
Do not rest your foot on the brake
pedal while driving.
•
Avoid carrying unnecessary weight.
•
Avoid adding particular accessories to
your vehicle (e.g. bug deflectors,
rollbars/light bars, running boards, ski
racks).
•
Avoid driving with the wheels out of
alignment.
COLD WEATHER
PRECAUTIONS
The functional operation of some
components and systems can be affected
at temperatures below -13°F (-25°C).
DRIVING THROUGH WATER
WARNING: Do not drive through
flowing or deep water as you may lose
control of your vehicle.
Note: Driving through standing water can
cause vehicle damage.
Note: Engine damage can occur if water
enters the air filter.

•
Lightly press the brake pedal to dry the
brakes and to check that they work.
•
Check that the horn works.
•
Check that the exterior lights work.
•
Turn the steering wheel to check that
the steering power assist works.
FLOOR MATS
WARNING: Use a floor mat
designed to fit the footwell of your
vehicle that does not obstruct the pedal
area. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in the loss of control of your
vehicle, personal injury or death.
WARNING: Pedals that cannot
move freely can cause loss of vehicle
control and increase the risk of serious
personal injury.
WARNING: Secure the floor mat
to both retention devices so that it
cannot slip out of position and interfere
with the pedals. Failure to follow this
instruction could result in the loss of
control of your vehicle, personal injury or
death.
WARNING: Do not place
additional floor mats or any other
covering on top of the original floor mats.
This could result in the floor mat
interfering with the operation of the
pedals. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in the loss of control of your
vehicle, personal injury or death.
WARNING: Always make sure that
objects cannot fall into the driver foot
well while your vehicle is moving. Objects
that are loose can become trapped
under the pedals causing a loss of
vehicle control.

pressing the brake pedal. Both ways
re-enable the fuel system.
Note:  When you try to restart your vehicle
after a fuel shutoff, the vehicle makes sure
that various systems are safe to restart.
Once your vehicle determines that the
systems are safe, then the vehicle will allow
you to restart.
Note: In the event that your vehicle does
not restart after your third attempt, contact
an authorized dealer.
JUMP STARTING THE VEHICLE
WARNING: Batteries normally
produce explosive gases which can
cause personal injury. Therefore, do not
allow flames, sparks or lighted
substances to come near the battery.
When working near the battery, always
shield your face and protect your eyes.
Always provide correct ventilation.
WARNING: Keep batteries out of
reach of children. Batteries contain
sulfuric acid. Avoid contact with skin,
eyes or clothing. Shield your eyes when
working near the battery to protect
against possible splashing of acid
solution. In case of acid contact with skin
or eyes, flush immediately with water for
a minimum of 15 minutes and get prompt
medical attention. If acid is swallowed,
call a physician immediately.
WARNING: Use only adequately
sized cables with insulated clamps.
Do not attempt to push-start your
automatic transmission vehicle.  Automatic
transmissions do not have push-start
capability.  Attempting to push-start a
vehicle with an automatic transmission
may cause transmission damage.
Preparing Your Vehicle
Note: Use only a 12 V supply to start your
vehicle.
Note: Do not disconnect the battery of the
disabled vehicle as this could damage the

GETTING THE SERVICES YOU
NEED
Warranty repairs to your vehicle must be
performed by an authorized dealer. While
any authorized dealer handling your vehicle
line will provide warranty service, we
recommend you return to your selling
authorized dealer who wants to ensure
your continued satisfaction.
Please note that certain warranty repairs
require special training and equipment, so
not all authorized dealers are authorized
to perform all warranty repairs. This means
that, depending on the warranty repair
needed, you may have to take your vehicle
to another authorized dealer.
A reasonable time must be allowed to
perform a repair after taking your vehicle
to the authorized dealer. Repairs will be
made using Ford or Motorcraft® parts, or
remanufactured or other parts that are
authorized by Ford.

In some states within the United States,
you must directly notify Ford in writing
before pursuing remedies under your
state's warranty laws, and Ford is also
allowed a final repair attempt.
Additionally, in some states within the
United States, a consumer has the option
of submitting a warranty dispute to the
BBB Auto Line before taking action under
the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, or to
the extent allowed by state law, before
pursuing replacement or repurchase
remedies provided by certain state laws.
This dispute handling procedure is not
required prior to enforcing state created
rights or other rights which are independent
of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act or
state replacement or repurchase laws.
IN CALIFORNIA (U.S. ONLY)
California Civil Code Section 1793.2(d)
requires that, if a manufacturer or its
representative is unable to repair a motor
vehicle to conform to the vehicle’s
applicable express warranty after a
reasonable number of attempts, the
manufacturer shall be required to either
replace the vehicle with one substantially
identical or repurchase the vehicle and
reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to
the actual price paid or payable by the
consumer (less a reasonable allowance
for consumer use). The consumer has the
right to choose whether to receive a refund
or replacement vehicle.
California Civil Code Section 1793.22(b)
presumes that the manufacturer has had
a reasonable number of attempts to
conform the vehicle to its applicable
express warranties if, within the first 18
months of ownership of a new vehicle or
the first 18,000 mi (29,000 km), whichever
occurs first:
1.
Two or more repair attempts are made
on the same non-conformity likely to
cause death or serious bodily injury OR
2.
Four or more repair attempts are made
on the same nonconformity (a defect
or condition that substantially impairs
the use, value or safety of the vehicle)
OR
3.
The vehicle is out of service for repair
of nonconformities for a total of more
than 30 calendar days (not necessarily
all at one time).
In the case of 1 or 2 above, the consumer
must also notify the manufacturer of the
need for the repair of the nonconformity
at the following address:

You are required to submit your warranty
dispute to BBB AUTO LINE before asserting
in court any rights or remedies conferred
by California Civil Code Section 1793.22(b).
You are also required to use BBB AUTO
LINE before exercising rights or seeking
remedies created by the Federal
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C.
sec. 2301 et seq. If you choose to seek
redress by pursuing rights and remedies
not created by California Civil Code Section
1793.22(b) or the Magnuson-Moss
Warranty Act, resort to BBB AUTO LINE is
not required by those statutes.
THE BETTER BUSINESS
BUREAU (BBB) AUTO LINE
PROGRAM (U.S. ONLY)
Your satisfaction is important to Ford
Motor Company and to your dealer. If a
warranty concern has not been resolved
using the three-step procedure outlined
earlier in this chapter in the Getting the
Services you need section, you may be
eligible to participate in the BBB AUTO
LINE program.
The BBB AUTO LINE program consists of
two parts – mediation and arbitration.
During mediation, a representative of the
BBB will contact both you and Ford Motor
Company to explore options for settlement
of the claim. If an agreement is not reached
during mediation or you do not want to
participate in mediation, and if your claim
is eligible, you may participate in the
arbitration process. An arbitration hearing
will be scheduled so that you can present
your case in an informal setting before an
impartial person. The arbitrator will
consider the testimony provided and make
a decision after the hearing.
Disputes submitted to the BBB AUTO LINE
program are usually decided within forty
days after you file your claim with the BBB.
You are not bound by the decision, and
may reject the decision and proceed to
court where all findings of the BBB Auto
Line dispute, and decision, are admissible
in the court action. Should you choose to
accept the BBB AUTO LINE decision, Ford
is then bound by the decision, and must
comply with the decision within 30 days
of receipt of your acceptance letter.
BBB AUTO LINE Application: Using the
information provided below, please call or
write to request a program application.
You will be asked for your name and
address, general information about your
new vehicle, information about your
warranty concerns, and any steps you have
already taken to try to resolve them. A
Customer Claim Form will be mailed that
will need to be completed, signed and
returned to the BBB along with proof of
ownership. Upon receipt, the BBB will
review the claim for eligibility under the
Program Summary Guidelines.
You can get more information by
calling BBB AUTO LINE at
1-800-955-5100, or writing to:
BBB AUTO LINE
3033 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600
Arlington, Virginia 22201
BBB AUTO LINE applications can also be
requested by calling the Ford Motor
Company Customer Relationship Center
at 1-800-392-3673.
For additional information refer to the
Better Business Bureau website.
Note: Ford Motor Company reserves the
right to change eligibility limitations, modify
procedures, or to discontinue this process
at any time without notice and without
obligation.

UTILIZING THE
MEDIATION/ARBITRATION
PROGRAM (CANADA ONLY)
For vehicles delivered to authorized
Canadian dealers. In those cases where
you continue to feel that the efforts by Ford
of Canada and the authorized dealer to
resolve a factory-related vehicle service
concern have been unsatisfactory, Ford of
Canada participates in an impartial third
party mediation/arbitration program
administered by the Canadian Motor
Vehicle Arbitration Plan (CAMVAP).
The CAMVAP program is a straight forward
and relatively speedy alternative to resolve
a disagreement when all other efforts to
produce a settlement have failed. This
procedure is without cost to you and is
designed to eliminate the need for lengthy
and expensive legal proceedings.
In the CAMVAP program, impartial
third-party arbitrators conduct hearings at
mutually convenient times and places in
an informal environment. These impartial
arbitrators review the positions of the
parties, make decisions and, when
appropriate, render awards to resolve
disputes. CAMVAP decisions are fast, fair,
and final as the arbitrator’s award is
binding on both you and Ford of Canada.
CAMVAP services are available in all
Canadian territories and provinces. For
more information, without charge or
obligation, call your CAMVAP Provincial
Administrator directly at 1-800-207-0685
or visit www.camvap.ca.

CANADA
Before exporting your vehicle to a foreign
country, contact the appropriate foreign
embassy or consulate. These officials can

ENGINE COOLING FAN
WARNING: Keep your hands and
clothing clear of the engine cooling fan.
Under certain conditions, the engine
cooling fan may continue to run for several
minutes after you switch your vehicle off.
This could happen in low ambient
temperatures and independent of the
engine coolant temperature, for example
short journeys or low coolant temperature.
ENGINE COOLANT CHECK
WARNING: Do not add engine
coolant when the engine is on or the
cooling system is hot. Failure to follow
this instruction could result in personal
injury.
WARNING: Do not put coolant in
the windshield washer reservoir. If
sprayed on the windshield, coolant could
make it difficult to see through the
windshield.
WARNING: To reduce the risk of
personal injury, make sure the engine is
cool before unscrewing the coolant
pressure relief cap. The cooling system
is under pressure. Steam and hot liquid
can come out forcefully when you loosen
the cap slightly.
WARNING: Do not add coolant
further than the MAX mark.
When the engine is cold, check the
concentration and level of the coolant at
the intervals listed in the scheduled
maintenance information. See Scheduled
Maintenance (page 373).
Note: Make sure that the coolant level is
between the MIN and MAX marks on the
coolant reservoir.
Note:  Coolant expands when it is hot.  The
level may extend beyond the MAX mark.
Maintain coolant concentration within
48% to 50%, which equates to a freeze
point between -30°F (-34°C) and -34°F
(-37°C). Coolant concentration should be
checked using a refractometer. We do not
recommend the use of hydrometers or
coolant test strips for measuring coolant
concentration.
Adding Coolant
WARNING: Do not remove the
coolant reservoir cap when the engine is
on or the cooling system is hot. Wait 10
minutes for the cooling system to cool
down. Cover the coolant reservoir cap
with a thick cloth to prevent the
possibility of scalding and slowly remove
the cap. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in personal injury.
Note:  Automotive fluids are not
interchangeable.  Do not use coolant or
windshield washer fluid outside of its
specified function and vehicle location.
Note:  Do not use stop leak pellets, cooling
system sealants, or non-specified additives
as they can cause damage to the engine
cooling or heating systems.  Resulting
component damage may not be covered by
the vehicle Warranty.

Maintenance
It is very important to use prediluted
coolant approved to the correct
specification in order to avoid plugging the
small passageways in the engine cooling
system.  See Capacities and
Specifications (page 278).  Do not mix
different colors or types of coolant in your
vehicle. Mixing of engine coolants or using
an incorrect coolant may harm the engine
or cooling system components and may
not be covered by the vehicle Warranty.
Note: If prediluted coolant is not available,
use the approved concentrated coolant
diluting it to 50/50 with distilled water.  See
Capacities and Specifications (page 278).
Using water that has not been deionised
may contribute to deposit formation,
corrosion and plugging of the small cooling
system passageways.
Note:  Coolants marketed for all makes and
models may not be approved to Ford
specifications and may cause damage to
the cooling system.  Resulting component
damage may not be covered by the vehicle
Warranty.
If the coolant level is at or below the
minimum mark, add prediluted coolant
immediately.
To top up the coolant level do the
following:
1.
Unscrew the cap slowly. Any pressure
escapes as you unscrew the cap.
2.
Add prediluted coolant approved to
the correct specification.  See
Capacities and Specifications (page
278).
3.
Add enough prediluted coolant to
reach the correct level.
4.
Replace the coolant reservoir cap, turn
it clockwise until you feel a strong
resistance.
5.
Check the coolant level in the coolant
reservoir the next few times you drive
your vehicle. If necessary, add enough
prediluted engine coolant to bring the
coolant level to the correct level.
If you have to add more than 1.1 qt (1 L) of
engine coolant per month, have your
vehicle checked as soon as possible.
Operating an engine with a low level of
coolant can result in engine overheating
and possible engine damage.
Note: During normal vehicle operation, the
coolant may change color from orange to
pink or light red. As long as the coolant is
clear and uncontaminated, this color change
does not indicate the coolant has degraded
nor does it require the coolant to be drained,
the system to be flushed, or the coolant to
be replaced.
Note: In case of emergency, you can add a
large amount of water without coolant in
order to reach a vehicle service location.
Water alone, without coolant, can cause
engine damage from corrosion, overheating
or freezing. When you reach a service
location, you must have the cooling system
drained and refilled with prediluted coolant
approved to the correct specification.  See
Capacities and Specifications (page 278).
Do not use the following as a coolant
substitute:
•
Alcohol.
•
Methanol.
•
Brine.
•
Any coolant mixed with alcohol or
methanol antifreeze.
Alcohol and other liquids can cause engine
damage from overheating or freezing.
Do not add extra inhibitors or additives to
the coolant. These can be harmful and
compromise the corrosion protection of
the coolant.

Recycled Coolant
We do not recommend the use of recycled
coolant as an approved recycling process
is not yet available.
Dispose of used engine coolant in an
appropriate manner. Follow your
community’s regulations and standards
for recycling and disposing of automotive
fluids.
Severe Climates
If you drive in extremely cold climates:
•
It may be necessary to increase the
coolant concentration above 50%.
•
A coolant concentration of 60%
provides improved freeze point
protection.  Coolant concentrations
above 60% decrease the overheat
protection characteristics of the
coolant and may cause engine
damage.
If you drive in extremely hot climates:
•
You can decrease the coolant
concentration to 40%.
•
Coolant concentrations below 40%
decrease the freeze and corrosion
protection characteristics of the
coolant and may cause engine
damage.
Vehicles driven year-round in non-extreme
climates should use prediluted coolant for
optimum cooling system and engine
protection.
Coolant Change
At specific mileage intervals, as listed in
the scheduled maintenance information,
the coolant should be changed. Add
prediluted coolant approved to the correct
specification.  See Capacities and
Specifications (page 278).
Fail-Safe Cooling
Fail-safe cooling allows you to temporarily
drive your vehicle before any incremental
component damage occurs. The fail-safe
distance depends on ambient
temperature, vehicle load and terrain.
How Fail-Safe Cooling Works
If the engine begins to overheat, the
coolant temperature gauge moves toward
the red zone:
A warning lamp illuminates and
a message may appear in the
information display.
If the engine reaches a preset
over-temperature condition, the engine
automatically switches to alternating
cylinder operation.  Each disabled cylinder
acts as an air pump and cools the engine.
When this occurs, your vehicle still
operates, however:
•
Engine power is limited.
•
The air conditioning system turns off.
Continued operation increases the engine
temperature, causing the engine to
completely shut down.  Your steering and
braking effort increases in this situation.
When the engine temperature cools, you
can re-start the engine. Have your vehicle
checked as soon as possible to minimize
engine damage.

Maintenance
When Fail-Safe Mode Is Activated
WARNING: Fail-safe mode is for
use during emergencies only. Operate
your vehicle in fail-safe mode only as
long as necessary to bring your vehicle
to rest in a safe location and seek
immediate repairs. When in fail-safe
mode, your vehicle will have limited
power, will not be able to maintain
high-speed operation, and may
completely shut down without warning,
potentially losing engine power, power
steering assist, and power brake assist,
which may increase the possibility of a
crash resulting in serious injury.
WARNING: Do not remove the
coolant reservoir cap when the engine is
on or the cooling system is hot. Wait 10
minutes for the cooling system to cool
down. Cover the coolant reservoir cap
with a thick cloth to prevent the
possibility of scalding and slowly remove
the cap. Failure to follow this instruction
could result in personal injury.
Your vehicle has limited engine power
when in the fail-safe mode, drive your
vehicle with caution. Your vehicle does not
maintain high-speed operation and the
engine may operate poorly.
Remember that the engine is capable of
automatically shutting down to prevent
engine damage.  In this situation:
1.
Pull off the road as soon as safely
possible and switch the engine off.
2.
If you are a member of a roadside
assistance program, we recommend
that you contact your roadside
assistance service provider.
3.
If this is not possible, wait a short
period for the engine to cool.
4.
Check the coolant level. If the coolant
level is at or below the minimum mark,
add prediluted coolant immediately.
5.
When the engine temperature cools,
you can re-start the engine. Have your
vehicle checked as soon as possible to
minimize engine damage.
Note: Driving your vehicle without repair
increases the chance of engine damage.
Engine Coolant Temperature
Management (If Equipped)
WARNING: To reduce the risk of
crash and injury, be prepared that the
vehicle speed may reduce and the
vehicle may not be able to accelerate
with full power until the coolant
temperature reduces.
If you tow a trailer with your vehicle, the
engine may temporarily reach a higher
temperature during severe operating
conditions, for example ascending a long
or steep grade in high ambient
temperatures.
At this time, you may notice the coolant
temperature gauge moves toward the red
zone and a message may appear in the
information display.
You may notice a reduction in vehicle
speed caused by reduced engine power.
In order to manage the engine coolant
temperature. Your vehicle may enter this
mode if certain high-temperature and
high-load conditions take place. The
amount of speed reduction depends on
vehicle loading, grade and ambient
temperature. If this occurs, there is no need
to pull off the road. You can continue to
drive your vehicle.

Maintenance
The air conditioning may automatically
turn on and off during severe operating
conditions to protect the engine from
overheating. When the coolant
temperature decreases to the normal
operating temperature, the air conditioning
turns on.
If the coolant temperature gauge moves
fully into the red zone, or if the coolant
temperature warning or service engine
soon messages appear in your information
display, do the following:
1.
Pull off the road as soon as safely
possible and shift the transmission into
park (P).
2.
Leave the engine running until the
coolant temperature gauge needle
returns to the normal position. After
several minutes, if the temperature
does not drop, follow the remaining
steps.
3.
Switch the engine off and wait for it to
cool. Check the coolant level.
4.
If the coolant level is at or below the
minimum mark, add prediluted coolant
immediately.
5.
If the coolant level is normal, restart
the engine and continue.
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
FLUID CHECK
The automatic transmission does not have
a transmission fluid dipstick.
Have an authorized dealer check and
change the transmission fluid at the
correct service interval.  See Scheduled
Maintenance (page 373).  Your
transmission does not consume fluid.
However, if the transmission slips, shifts
slowly or if you notice a sign of leaking
fluid, contact an authorized dealer.
Do not use supplemental transmission
fluid additives, treatments or cleaning
agents. The use of these materials may
affect transmission operation and result
in damage to internal transmission
components.
BRAKE FLUID CHECK
WARNING: Do not use any fluid
other than the recommended brake fluid
as this will reduce brake efficiency. Use
of incorrect fluid could result in the loss
of vehicle control, serious personal injury
or death.
WARNING: Only use brake fluid
from a sealed container. Contamination
with dirt, water, petroleum products or
other materials may result in brake
system damage or failure. Failure to
adhere to this warning could result in the
loss of vehicle control, serious personal
injury or death.
WARNING: Do not allow the fluid
to touch your skin or eyes. If this
happens, rinse the affected areas
immediately with plenty of water and
contact your physician.
WARNING: The brake system
could be affected if the brake fluid level
is below the MIN mark or above the MAX
mark on the brake fluid reservoir.

Maintenance
1.
Park your vehicle on a level surface.
2.
Look at the brake fluid reservoir to see
where the brake fluid level is relative
to the MIN and the MAX marks on the
reservoir.
Note: If the brake fluid level is between the
MIN and the MAX marks on the reservoir, it
is acceptable.
Note: If the brake fluid level is below the
MIN mark or above the MAX mark, have
your vehicle checked as soon as possible.
Note: To avoid fluid contamination, the
reservoir cap must remain in place and fully
tight, unless you are adding fluid.
Only use fluid that meets our
specifications.  See Capacities and
Specifications (page 278).
Brake Fluid Service Interval
Brake fluid absorbs water over time which
degrades the effectiveness of the brake
fluid. Change the brake fluid at the
specified intervals to prevent degraded
braking performance.
For detailed interval information, see
Scheduled Maintenance in your Owner's
Manual or your local maintenance guide.
WASHER FLUID CHECK
WARNING: If you operate your
vehicle in temperatures below 40°F
(5°C), use washer fluid with antifreeze
protection. Failure to use washer fluid
with antifreeze protection in cold
weather could result in impaired
windshield vision and increase the risk
of injury or accident.
Add fluid to fill the reservoir if the level is
low. Only use a washer fluid that meets
Ford specifications.  See Capacities and
Specifications (page 278).
State or local regulations on volatile
organic compounds may restrict the use
of methanol, a common windshield washer
antifreeze additive. Washer fluids
containing non-methanol antifreeze
agents should be used only if they provide
cold weather protection without damaging
the vehicle’s paint finish, wiper blades or
washer system.
FUEL FILTER
Your vehicle is equipped with a lifetime
fuel filter that is integrated with the fuel
tank. Regular maintenance or replacement
is not needed.

with a wire brush.  You can neutralize the
acid with a solution of baking soda and
water.
We recommend that you disconnect the
negative battery cable terminal from the
battery if you plan to store your vehicle for
an extended period.

Maintenance
To maintain correct operation of the
battery management system, if you add
any electrical devices to your vehicle, do
not connect the ground connection directly
to the negative battery terminal.  A
connection at the negative battery terminal
can cause inaccurate measurements of
the battery condition and potential
incorrect system operation.
Note: Electrical accessories or components
added to your vehicle by you or an
authorized dealer, may adversely affect
battery performance, durability and the
performance of other electrical systems on
your vehicle.
If a replacement battery is required, we
recommend you use a Ford replacement
battery that matches the electrical
requirements of your vehicle.
If you disconnect or replace the battery
and your vehicle has an automatic
transmission, transmission must relearn
its adaptive strategy. Because of this, the
transmission may shift firmly when first
driven. This is normal operation while the
transmission fully updates its operation to
optimum shift feel.
Remove and Reinstall the Battery
To disconnect or remove the battery, do
the following:
1.
Apply the parking brake and switch the
ignition off.
2.
Switch all electrical equipment off, for
example lights and radio.
3.
Wait a minimum of two minutes before
disconnecting the battery.
Note: The engine management system has
a power hold function and remains powered
for a period after you switch the ignition off.
This is to allow diagnostic and adaptive
tables to be stored. Disconnecting the
battery without waiting can cause damage
not covered by the vehicle Warranty.
4.
Disconnect the negative (-) battery
cable terminal first.
5.
Disconnect the positive (+) battery
cable terminal last.
6.
Remove the battery securing clamp.
7.
Remove the battery.
8.
Install in the reverse order.
Note: Before reconnecting the battery,
make sure the ignition remains switched off.
Note: If you only disconnect the negative
battery cable terminal, make sure it is
isolated or placed away from the battery
terminal to avoid un-intended connection
or arcing.
Note: Make sure the battery cable terminals
are fully tightened.
Note: If you disconnect or replace the
battery, you must reset the clock and the
pre-set radio stations once the battery is
reconnected.
Battery Disposal
Make sure that you dispose of
old batteries in an
environmentally friendly way.
Seek advice from your local authority
about recycling old batteries.
CHECKING THE WIPER
BLADES

CLEANING THE EXTERIOR
Wash your vehicle regularly with cool or
lukewarm water and a neutral pH
shampoo, we recommend Motorcraft
Detail Wash.
•
Never use strong household detergents
or soap, for example dish washing or
laundry liquid. These products can
discolor and spot painted surfaces.
•
Never wash your vehicle when it is hot
to the touch, or during strong or direct
sunlight.
•
Dry your vehicle with a chamois or soft
terry cloth towel to eliminate water
spotting.
•
Immediately remove fuel spillages, bird
droppings, insect deposits and road tar.
These may cause damage to your
vehicle’s paintwork or trim over time.
We recommend Motorcraft Bug and
Tar Remover.
•
Remove any exterior accessories, for
example antennas, before entering a
car wash.
•
When filling with AdBlue®, remove any
residue on painted surfaces
immediately.
Note: Suntan lotions and insect repellents
can damage painted surfaces. If these
substances come in contact with your
vehicle, wash the affected area as soon as
possible.
Cleaning the Headlamps
Note: Do not scrape the headlamp lenses
or use abrasives, alcoholic solvents or
chemical solvents to clean them.
240
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Vehicle Care
Note: Do not wipe the headlamps when
they are dry.
Exterior Chrome Parts
•
Apply a high quality-cleaning product
to bumpers and other chrome parts.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
We recommend Motorcraft Custom
Bright Metal Cleaner.
•
Do not apply the cleaning product to
hot surfaces. Do not leave the cleaning
product on chrome surfaces longer
than the time recommended.
•
Using non-recommended cleaners can
result in severe and permanent
cosmetic damage.
Note: Never use abrasive materials, for
example steel wool or plastic pads as they
can scratch the chrome surface.
Note: Do not use chrome cleaner, metal
cleaner or polish on wheels or wheel covers.
Exterior Plastic Parts
For routine cleaning we recommend
Motorcraft Detail Wash. If tar or grease
spots are present, we recommend
Motorcraft Bug and Tar Remover.
Stripes or Graphics (If Equipped)
Hand washing your vehicle is preferred
however, pressure washing may be used
under the following conditions:
•
Do not use water pressure higher than
2,000 psi (14,000 kPa).
•
Do not use water hotter than 179°F
(82°C).
•
Use a spray with a 40° wide spray
angle pattern.
•
Keep the nozzle at a 12 in (305 mm)
distance and 90° angle to your
vehicle's surface.
Note: Holding the pressure washer nozzle
at an angle to the vehicle's surface may
damage graphics and cause the edges to
peel away from the vehicle's surface.
Underbody
Regularly clean the underside of your
vehicle using water. Keep body and door
drain holes free of debris or foreign
material.
Under Hood
For removing black rubber marks from
under the hood we recommend Motorcraft
Wheel and Tire Cleaner or Motorcraft Bug
and Tar Remover.
WAXING
Regular waxing is necessary to protect your
car's paint from the elements. We
recommend that you wash and wax the
painted surface once or twice a year.
When washing and waxing, park your
vehicle in a shaded area out of direct
sunlight. Always wash your vehicle before
applying wax.
•
Use a quality wax that does not contain
abrasives.
•
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions
to apply and remove the wax.
•
Apply a small amount of wax in a
back-and-forth motion, not in circles.
241
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Vehicle Care
•
Do not allow wax to come in contact
with any non-body (low-gloss black)
colored trim. The wax will discolor or
stain the parts over time.
•
Roof racks.
•
Bumpers.
•
Grained door handles.
•
Side moldings.
•
Mirror housings.
•
Windshield cowl area.
•
Do not apply wax to glass areas.
•
After waxing, your car's paint should
feel smooth, and be free of streaks and
smudges.
CLEANING THE ENGINE
Engines are more efficient when they are
clean because grease and dirt buildup keep
the engine warmer than normal.
When washing:
•
Take care when using a power washer
to clean the engine. The high-pressure
fluid could penetrate the sealed parts
and cause damage.
•
Do not spray a hot engine with cold
water to avoid cracking the engine
block or other engine components.
•
Spray Motorcraft Engine Shampoo and
Degreaser on all parts that require
cleaning and pressure rinse clean. In
Canada, use Motorcraft Engine
Shampoo.
Note: If your vehicle has an engine cover
remove the cover before application of
Motorcraft Engine Shampoo and Degreaser.
Immediately rinse away any over spray.
•
Never wash or rinse the engine while it
is hot or running; water in the running
engine may cause internal damage.
•
Never wash or rinse any ignition coil,
spark plug wire or spark plug well, or
the area in and around these locations.
•
Cover the battery, power distribution
box, and air filter assembly to prevent
water damage when cleaning the
engine.
CLEANING THE WINDOWS AND
WIPER BLADES
Car wash chemicals and environmental
fallout can result in windshield and wiper
blade contamination. Dirty windshield and
wipers will result in poor windshield wiper
operation. Keep the windshield and wiper
blades clean to maintain windshield wiper
performance.
To clean the windshield and wiper blades:
•
Clean the windshield with a
non-abrasive glass cleaner. When
cleaning the interior of the windshield,
avoid getting any glass cleaner on the
instrument panel or door panels. Wipe
any glass cleaner off these surfaces
immediately.
•
For windshields contaminated with
tree sap, chemicals, wax or bugs, clean
the entire windshield using steel wool
(no greater than 0000 grade) in a
circular motion and rinse with water.
•
Clean the wiper blades with isopropyl
rubbing alcohol or windshield washer
concentrate.
Note:  Do not use razor blades or other
sharp objects to clean or remove decals
from the inside of the heated rear window.
The vehicle warranty does not cover
damage caused to the heated rear window
grid lines.

Vehicle Care
CLEANING THE INTERIOR
WARNING: Do not use cleaning
solvents, bleach or dye on the vehicle's
seatbelts, as these actions may weaken
the belt webbing.
WARNING: On vehicles equipped
with seat-mounted airbags, do not use
chemical solvents or strong detergents.
Such products could contaminate the
side airbag system and affect
performance of the side airbag in a crash.
For fabric, carpets, cloth seats and seats
equipped with side airbags:
•
Remove dust and loose dirt with a
vacuum cleaner.
•
Remove light stains and soil with
Motorcraft Professional Strength
Carpet & Upholstery Cleaner.
•
If grease or tar is present on the
material, spot-clean the area first with
Motorcraft Spot and Stain Remover. In
Canada, use Motorcraft Multi-Purpose
Cleaner.
•
If a ring forms on the fabric after spot
cleaning, clean the entire area
immediately (but do not oversaturate)
or the ring will set.
•
Do not use household cleaning
products or glass cleaners, which can
stain and discolor the fabric and affect
the flame retardant abilities of the seat
materials.
Mirrors
Do not clean the housing or glass of any
mirror with harsh abrasives, fuel or other
petroleum or ammonia-based cleaning
products.
CLEANING THE INSTRUMENT
PANEL AND INSTRUMENT
CLUSTER LENS
WARNING: Do not use chemical
solvents or strong detergents when
cleaning the steering wheel or
instrument panel to avoid contamination
of the airbag system.
Note: Follow the same procedure as
cleaning leather seats for cleaning leather
instrument panels and leather interior trim
surfaces.  See Cleaning Leather Seats
(page 244).
Clean the instrument panel and cluster
lens with a clean, damp and soft cloth,
then use a clean, dry and soft cloth to dry
these areas.
•
Avoid cleaners or polishes that increase
the gloss of the upper portion of the
instrument panel. The dull finish in this
area helps protect you from
undesirable windshield reflection.
•
Do not use any household cleaning
products or glass cleaners as these
may damage the finish of the
instrument panel, interior trim and
cluster lens.
•
Wash or wipe your hands clean if you
have been in contact with certain
products such as insect repellent and
suntan lotion to avoid possible damage
to the interior painted surfaces.
•
Do not allow air fresheners and hand
sanitizers to spill onto interior surfaces.
If a spill occurs, wipe off immediately.
Your warranty may not cover these
damages.
If a staining liquid like coffee or juice has
been spilled on the instrument panel or on
interior trim surfaces:

Vehicle Care
1.
Wipe up spilled liquid using a clean,
soft cloth as quickly as possible.
2.
Use Motorcraft Premium Leather and
Vinyl Cleaner or a commercially
available leather cleaning product for
automotive interiors. Test any cleaner
or stain remover on an inconspicuous
area.

Alternatively, wipe the surface with a
clean, soft cloth and a mild soap and
water solution. Dry the area with a
clean, soft cloth.
4.
If necessary, apply more soap and
water solution or cleaning product to
a clean, soft cloth and press it onto the
soiled area. Allow this to set at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
5.
Remove the soaked cloth, then with a
clean, damp cloth, use a rubbing
motion for 60 seconds on the soiled
area.
6.
Dry the area with a clean, soft cloth.
CLEANING LEATHER SEATS (IF
EQUIPPED)
Note: Follow the same procedure as
cleaning leather seats for cleaning leather
instrument panels and leather interior trim
surfaces.
For routine cleaning, wipe the surface with
a soft, damp cloth and a mild soap and
water solution. Dry the area with a clean,
soft cloth.
For cleaning and removing stains such as
dye transfer, use Motorcraft Premium
Leather and Vinyl Cleaner or a
commercially available leather cleaning
product for automotive interiors.
Note: Test any cleaner or stain remover on
an inconspicuous area.
You should:
•
Remove dust and loose dirt with a
vacuum cleaner.
•
Clean and treat spills and stains as
soon as possible.
Do not use the following products as these
may damage the leather:
•
Oil and petroleum or silicone-based
leather conditioners.
•
Household cleaners.
•
Alcohol solutions.
•
Solvents or cleaners intended
specifically for rubber, vinyl and
plastics.
REPAIRING MINOR PAINT
DAMAGE
You should repair paintwork damage
caused by stones from the road or minor
scratches as soon as possible. A choice of
products are available from an authorized
dealer.
Remove particles such as bird droppings,
tree sap, insect deposits, tar spots, road
salt and industrial fallout before repairing
paint chips.
Always read and follow the manufacturer’s
instructions before using the products.
CLEANING THE WHEELS
Note: Do not apply a cleaning chemical to
warm or hot wheel rims and covers.
Note: Industrial-strength (heavy-duty)
cleaners, or cleaning chemicals, in
combination with brush agitation to remove
brake dust and dirt, could wear away the

Vehicle Care
Note: If you intend parking your vehicle for
an extended period after cleaning the
wheels with a wheel cleaner, drive your
vehicle for a few minutes before doing so.
This will reduce the risk of increased
corrosion of the brake discs, brake pads and
linings.
Note: Some automatic car washes may
cause damage to the finish on your wheel
rims and covers.
Alloy wheels and wheel covers are coated
with a clear coat paint finish. To maintain
their condition we recommend that you:
•
Clean them weekly with the
recommended wheel and tire cleaner.
•
Use a sponge to remove heavy
deposits of dirt and brake dust
accumulation.
•
Rinse them thoroughly with a
pressurized stream of water when you
have completed the cleaning process.
We recommend that you use Ford service
wheel cleaner. Make sure that you read
and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
Using other non-recommended cleaning
products can result in severe and
permanent cosmetic damage.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Use only approved wheel and tire sizes,
using other sizes could damage your
vehicle. If you change the diameter of the
tires from that fitted at the factory, the
speedometer may not display the correct
speed. Take your vehicle to an authorized
Ford dealer to have the system
reprogrammed. If you intend to change the
size of the wheels from that fitted by the
manufacturer, you can check the suitability
with an authorized dealer.
Additional information related to the
functionality and maintenance of your tires
can be found later in this chapter.  See
General Information (page 248).
The Ford recommended tire inflation
pressures can be found on the Tire Label,
which is located on the B-pillar or the edge
of the driver's door. This information can
also be found on the Safety Compliance
Certification Label, affixed to either the
door hinge pillar, door-latch post, or the
door edge that meets the door latch post;
next to the driver’s seating position.
Ford strongly recommends maintaining
these tire pressures at all times. Failure to
follow the tire pressure recommendations
can cause uneven treadwear patterns,
reduced fuel economy, and adversely
affect the way your vehicle handles.
Note: Check and set the tire pressure at the
ambient temperature in which you are
intending to drive your vehicle and when the
tires are cold.
Note: Check your tire pressures at least
once per month.
Set the pressure for your spare tire to the
highest value given for your vehicle and tire
size combination, if equipped.
Notice to utility vehicle and truck
owners
WARNING: Utility vehicles have a
significantly higher rollover rate than
other types of vehicles.
WARNING: Vehicles with a higher
center of gravity (utility and four-wheel
drive vehicles) handle differently than
vehicles with a lower center of gravity
(passenger cars). Avoid sharp turns,
excessive speed and abrupt steering in
these vehicles. Failure to drive cautiously
increases the risk of losing control of your
vehicle, vehicle rollover, personal injury
and death.
WARNING: In a rollover crash, an
unbelted person is significantly more
likely to die than a person wearing a
seatbelt.
WARNING: Do not become
overconfident in the ability of four-wheel
drive vehicles. Although a four-wheel
drive vehicle may accelerate better than
a two-wheel drive vehicle in low traction
situations, it won't stop any faster than
two-wheel drive vehicles. Always drive
at a safe speed.
Utility vehicles and trucks handle
differently than passenger cars in the
various driving conditions that are
encountered on streets, highways and
off-road. Utility vehicles and trucks are not
designed for cornering at speeds as high
as passenger cars any more than low-slung
sports cars are designed to perform
satisfactorily under off-road conditions.

Wheels and Tires
Study your owner's manual and any
supplements for specific information about
equipment features, instructions for safe
driving and additional precautions to
reduce the risk of an accident or serious
injury.
How your vehicle differs from
other vehicles
Sport utility vehicles and trucks can differ
from some other vehicles in a few
noticeable ways. Your vehicle may be:
•
Higher - to allow higher load carrying
capacity and to allow it to travel over
rough terrain without getting hung up
or damaging underbody components.
•
Shorter - to give it the capability to
approach inclines and drive over the
crest of a hill without getting hung up
or damaging underbody components.
All other things held equal, a shorter
wheelbase may make your vehicle
quicker to respond to steering inputs
than a vehicle with a longer wheelbase.
•
Narrower - to provide greater
maneuverability in tight spaces,
particularly in off-road use.
As a result of the above dimensional
differences, Sport utility vehicles and
trucks often have a higher center of gravity
and a greater difference in center of gravity
between the loaded and unloaded
condition. These differences that make
your vehicle so versatile also make it
handle differently than an ordinary
passenger car.
TIRE SEALANT AND INFLATOR
KIT
Your vehicle may not have a spare wheel
and tire. In these cases it will be supplied
with a temporary mobility kit which will
only repair one damaged tire. Only use the
kit supplied with your vehicle.
Note: The kit may be used as an air
compressor for tire inflation maintenance
when the sealant bottle is not assembled
to the compressor.
The kit is located under the floor in the
luggage compartment.
Compressor
A
Sealant bottle
B
The kit consists of an air compressor to
inflate the tire and a sealing compound in
a canister that will effectively seal most
punctures caused by nails or similar
objects. This kit will provide a temporary
tire repair allowing you to drive your vehicle
up to 120 mi (200 km) at a maximum
speed of 50 mph (80 km/h) to reach a tire
service location.
Note: Sealant compound contains latex.
Use appropriate precautions to avoid any
allergic reactions.
General Information
WARNING: Failure to follow these
guidelines could result in an increased
risk of loss of vehicle control, injury or
death.
249

Wheels and Tires
Punctures larger than 0.24 in (6 mm) may
not be sealable. Tire sidewall damage
cannot be temporarily repaired.
Note: Do note use the kit if you have
severely damaged a tire. Only seal
punctures located within the tire tread with
the kit.
Loss of air pressure may adversely affect
tire performance. For this reason:
•
Drive carefully and avoid abrupt
steering maneuvers.
•
Periodically monitor tire inflation
pressure in the affected tire; if the tire
is losing pressure, have the vehicle
towed.
•
Read the information in the Tips for
Use of the Kit section to make sure safe
operation of the kit and your vehicle.
Note: Do not drive the vehicle above
50 mph (80 km/h).
Note: Do not drive further than 124 mi
(200 km). Drive only to the closest
authorized Ford dealer or tire repair shop to
have your tire inspected.
Tips for use of the kit
To ensure safe operation of the kit:
•
Read all instructions and cautions fully.
•
Before operating the kit, make sure
your vehicle is safely off the road and
away from moving traffic. Switch on
the hazard lights.
•
Always set the parking brake to ensure
the vehicle doesn't move unexpectedly.
•
Do not remove any foreign objects,
such as nails or screws, from the tire.
•
When using the kit, if the vehicle is
outdoors or in a well-ventilated area,
leave the engine running so the
compressor does not drain the
vehicle's battery.
•
Do not allow the compressor to
operate continuously for more than 15
minutes. This will help prevent the
compressor from overheating.
•
Never leave the kit unattended when
it is operating.
•
Keep the kit away from children.
•
Only use the kit when the ambient
temperature is between -22.0°F
(-30°C) and 157.9°F (70°C).
•
Only use the sealing compound before
the use-by date which is printed on the
top of sealant bottle.
•
After sealant use, an authorized Ford
dealer must replace the tire pressure
monitoring system sensor and valve
stem on the wheel.
•
Operating the kit could cause an
electrical disturbance in radio, CD, and
DVD player operation.
What to do when a tire is punctured
A tire puncture within the tire's tread area
can be sealed in two stages with the kit.
•
In the first stage, the tire will be
reinflated with a sealing compound
and air. After the tire has been inflated,
you will need to drive the vehicle
approximately 4 mi (6 km) to distribute
the sealant in the tire.
•
In the second stage, you will need to
check the tire pressure and adjust, if
necessary, to the vehicle's specified
tire inflation pressure.

First stage: reinflating the tire with
sealing compound and air
WARNING: Do not stand directly
over the kit while inflating the tire. If you
notice any unusual bulges or
deformations in the tire's sidewall during
inflation, stop and call roadside
assistance.
WARNING: If the tire does not
inflate to the recommended tire pressure
within 15 minutes, stop and call roadside
assistance.
WARNING: Do not run the engine
when operating the air compressor
unless the vehicle is outdoors or in a
well-ventilated area.
WARNING: The power plug may
get hot after use and should be handled
carefully when unplugging.
Park the vehicle in a safe, level and secure
area, away from moving traffic. Turn the
hazard lights on. Apply the parking brake
and turn the engine off. Inspect the flat tire
for visible damage.
Sealant compound contains latex. Use
appropriate precautions to avoid any
allergic reactions.
Do not remove any foreign object that has
pierced the tire. If a puncture is located in
the tire sidewall, stop and call roadside
assistance.

12.
Inflate the tire for no longer than 15
minutes to an inflation pressure of
minimum 26 psi (1.8 bar) and a
maximum of 51 psi (3.5 bar). Move
the compressor switch (D) to the OFF
position and check the current tire
pressure with pressure gauge (J).
Note: If the tire inflation pressure does not
reach 26 psi (180 kPa) within 15 minutes,
the tire may have suffered excessive
damage, making a temporary repair
impossible. Stop and call roadside
assistance.
Note: When pumping in the sealant through
the tire valve, the pressure may rise up to
87 psi (6 bar) but will drop again after a few
seconds.
Note: After you have switched the
compressor off, you may hear air escaping
from the damaged tire. This is normal and
can be ignored provided that the specified
minimum tire pressure has been reached.
13.
Remove the power plug (E) from the
12-volt power point.
14.
Unscrew the hose (H) from the tire
valve and put the protective cap (G)
back in place. Replace the valve cap
on the tire valve.
Note: Some residual sealant fluid may drip
or briefly spray out the hose (H) while you
are disconnecting it. This is normal.
15.
Do not remove the sealant bottle
from the compressor. This avoids
leakage of sealant residue.
16.
Make sure the kit, the bottle lid and
the orange cap are stored safely in
your vehicle. The kit will be required
again when you check the tire
pressure after driving the vehicle a
short distance.
17.
Immediately and cautiously, drive the
vehicle 3.7 mi (6 km) to distribute the
sealant evenly inside the tire. Do not
exceed 50 mph (80 km/h).
18.
After 4 mi (6 km), stop and check the
tire pressure.
Note: If you experience any unusual
vibration, ride disturbance or noise while
driving, do not proceed to the second stage
of this operation. Reduce your speed until
you can safely pull off to the side of the road
to call for roadside assistance.
Second stage: checking tire
pressure
Check the air pressure of your tires as
follows:
1.
Remove the valve cap from the tire
valve.
254
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Wheels and Tires
2.
Firmly screw the air compressor hose
onto the valve stem by turning
clockwise.
3.
With the compressor off, the gauge of
the kit will display the tire inflation
pressure.
Note: If you are proceeding from the First
stage: Reinflating the tire with sealing
compound and air section and have injected
sealant in the tire and the pressure is below
20 psi (1.4 bar), stop and call roadside
assistance. If tire pressure is above 20 psi
(1.4 bar), continue to the next step.
4.
If required, turn on the compressor and
adjust the tire to the recommended
inflation pressure shown on the tire
label located on the driver's door or
door jamb area. The tire pressure
should be checked with the
compressor turned OFF in order to get
an accurate pressure reading.
5.
Unscrew the compressor hose from
the valve stem and re-install the valve
cap. Leaving the sealant bottle
attached to the compressor unit, safely
store in your vehicle the tire sealant and
inflator kit, the bottle lid and the orange
cap.
What to do after the tire has been
sealed
Note: After the sealing compound has been
used, the maximum vehicle speed is 50 mph
(80 km/h) and the maximum driving
distance is 124 mi (200 km). The sealed tire
should be inspected immediately.
You can check the tire pressure any time
within the 124 mi (200 km) by performing
the procedure from Second stage:
Checking tire pressure.
Regularly check the tire pressure until the
sealed tire is repaired or replaced by a tire
specialist. Before the tire is removed from
the trim, you must inform the tire specialist
that the tire contains sealant.
After using the kit to seal your tire, you will
need to replace the sealant canister and
hose. Sealant canister and hose service
kits can be obtained at an authorized Ford
dealer. Empty sealant canisters may be
disposed of at home. However, canisters
still containing liquid sealant should be
disposed of by your local authorized Ford
dealer or tire dealer, or in accordance with
local waste disposal regulation.

and maximum section width. For
example: Treadwear 200
Traction AA Temperature A.
These Tire Quality Grades are
determined by standards that the
United States Department of
Transportation has set.

Wheels and Tires
Tire Quality Grades apply to new
pneumatic passenger car tires.
They do not apply to deep tread,
winter-type snow tires,
space-saver or temporary use
spare tires, light truck or LT type
tires, tires with nominal rim
diameters of 10 to 12 inches or
limited production tires as defined
in Title 49 Code of Federal
Regulations Part 575.104 ©)(2).
U.S. Department of
Transportation-Tire quality
grades:  The U.S. Department of
Transportation requires Ford
Motor Company to give you the
following information about tire
grades exactly as the government
has written it.
Treadwear
The treadwear grade is a
comparative rating based on the
wear rate of the tire when tested
under controlled conditions on a
specified government test course.
For example, a tire graded 150
would wear 1½ times as well on
the government course as a tire
graded 100. The relative
performance of tires depends
upon the actual conditions of their
use, however, and may depart
significantly from the norm due to
variations in driving habits, service
practices, and differences in road
characteristics and climate.
Traction AA A B C
WARNING: The traction
grade assigned to this tire is
based on straight-ahead braking
traction tests, and does not
include acceleration, cornering,
hydroplaning or peak traction
characteristics.
The traction grades, from highest
to lowest are AA, A, B, and C. The
grades represent the tire’s ability
to stop on wet pavement as
measured under controlled
conditions on specified
government test surfaces of
asphalt and concrete. A tire
marked C may have poor traction
performance.
Temperature A B C
WARNING: The
temperature grade for this tire is
established for a tire that is
properly inflated and not
overloaded. Excessive speed,
underinflation, or excessive
loading, either separately or in
combination, can cause heat
buildup and possible tire failure.
The temperature grades are A
(the highest), B and C,
representing the tire’s resistance
to the generation of heat and its
ability to dissipate heat when
tested under controlled conditions
on a specified indoor laboratory

test wheel. Sustained high
temperature can cause the
material of the tire to degenerate
and reduce tire life, and excessive
temperature can lead to sudden
tire failure. The grade C
corresponds to a level of
performance which all passenger
car tires must meet under the
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standard No. 139. Grades B and A
represent higher levels of
performance on the laboratory
test wheel than the minimum
required by law.
Glossary of Tire Terminology

Both U.S. and Canada Federal
regulations require tire
manufacturers to place
standardized information on the
sidewall of all tires. This
information identifies and
describes the fundamental
characteristics of the tire and also
provides a U.S. DOT Tire
Identification Number for safety
standard certification and in case
of a recall.
Information on P Type Tires
P215/65R15 95H is an example of
a tire size, load index and speed
rating. The definitions of these
items are listed below. (Note that
the tire size, load index and speed
rating for your vehicle may be
different from this example.)
A. P: Indicates a tire, designated
by the Tire and Rim Association,
that may be used for service on
cars, sport utility vehicles,
minivans and light trucks. Note: If
your tire size does not begin with
a letter, this may mean it is
designated by either the European
Tire and Rim Technical
Organization or the Japan Tire
Manufacturing Association.

Wheels and Tires
B. 215: Indicates the nominal
width of the tire in millimeters
from sidewall edge to sidewall
edge. In general, the larger the
number, the wider the tire.
C. 65: Indicates the aspect ratio
which gives the tire's ratio of
height to width.
D. R: Indicates a radial type tire.
E. 15: Indicates the wheel or rim
diameter in inches. If you change
your wheel size, you will have to
purchase new tires to match the
new wheel diameter.
F. 95: Indicates the tire's load
index. It is an index that relates to
how much weight a tire can carry.
You may find this information in
your owner’s manual. If not,
contact a local tire dealer.
Note: You may not find this
information on all tires because it
is not required by federal law.
G. H: Indicates the tire's speed
rating. The speed rating denotes
the speed at which a tire is
designed to be driven for extended
periods of time under a standard
condition of load and inflation
pressure. The tires on your vehicle
may operate at different
conditions for load and inflation
pressure. These speed ratings may
need to be adjusted for the
difference in conditions. The
ratings range from 81 mph
(130 km/h) to 186 mph
(299 km/h). These ratings are
listed in the following chart.
Note: You may not find this
information on all tires because it
is not required by federal law.
Speed rating

Note: For tires with a maximum
speed capability over 149 mph
(240 km/h), tire manufacturers
sometimes use the letters ZR. For
those with a maximum speed
capability over 186 mph (299
km/h), tire manufacturers always
use the letters ZR.
H. U.S. DOT Tire Identification
Number (TIN): This begins with
the letters DOT and indicates that
the tire meets all federal
standards. The next two numbers
or letters are the plant code
designating where it was
manufactured, the next two are
259

Wheels and Tires
the tire size code and the last four
numbers represent the week and
year the tire was built. For
example, the numbers 317 mean
the 31st week of 1997. After 2000
the numbers go to four digits. For
example, 2501 means the 25th
week of 2001. The numbers in
between are identification codes
used for traceability. This
information is used to contact
customers if a tire defect requires
a recall.
I. M+S or M/S: Mud and Snow, or
AT: All Terrain, or
AS: All Season.
J. Tire Ply Composition and
Material Used: Indicates the
number of plies or the number of
layers of rubber-coated fabric in
the tire tread and sidewall. Tire
manufacturers also must indicate
the ply materials in the tire and the
sidewall, which include steel,
nylon, polyester, and others.
K. Maximum Load: Indicates the
maximum load in kilograms and
pounds that can be carried by the
tire. Refer to the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position), for the correct tire
pressure for your vehicle.
L. Treadwear, Traction and
Temperature Grades:
*Treadwear The treadwear grade
is a comparative rating based on
the wear rate of the tire when
tested under controlled conditions
on a specified government test
course. For example, a tire graded
150 would wear one and one-half
times as well on the government
course as a tire graded 100.
*Traction: The traction grades,
from highest to lowest are AA, A,
B, and C. The grades represent the
tire's ability to stop on wet
pavement as measured under
controlled conditions on specified
government test surfaces of
asphalt and concrete. A tire
marked C may have poor traction
performance.
*Temperature: The temperature
grades are A (the highest), B and
C, representing the tire's
resistance to the generation of
heat and its ability to dissipate
heat when tested under controlled
conditions on a specified indoor
laboratory test wheel.
M. Maximum Inflation
Pressure: Indicates the tire
manufacturer's maximum
permissible pressure or the
pressure at which the maximum
load can be carried by the tire. This
pressure is normally higher than
the manufacturer's recommended
cold inflation pressure, which can
be found on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
260

post, next to the driver's seating
position), or Tire Label which is
located on the B-Pillar or the edge
of the driver’s door. The cold
inflation pressure should never be
set lower than the recommended
pressure on the vehicle label.
The tire suppliers may have
additional markings, notes or
warnings such as standard load,
radial tubeless, etc.
Additional Information
Contained on the Tire Sidewall
for LT Type Tires
LT type tires have some additional
information beyond those of P
type tires; these differences are
described below.
Note: Tire Quality Grades do not
apply to this type of tire.
A. LT: Indicates a tire, designated
by the Tire and Rim Association,
that is intended for service on light
trucks.
B. Load Range and Load
Inflation Limits: Indicates the
tire's load-carrying capabilities
and its inflation limits.
C. Maximum Load Dual lb (kg)
at psi (kPa) cold: Indicates the
maximum load and tire pressure
when the tire is used as a dual,
defined as four tires on the rear
axle (a total of six or more tires on
the vehicle).
D. Maximum Load Single lb
(kg) at psi (kPa) cold: Indicates
the maximum load and tire
pressure when the tire is used as
a single, defined as two tires
(total) on the rear axle.
Information on T Type Tires
T type tires have some additional
information beyond those of P
type tires; these differences are
described below:
T145/80D16 is an example of a
tire size.
Note: The temporary tire size for
your vehicle may be different from
this example. Tire Quality Grades
do not apply to this type of tire.

Wheels and Tires
A. T: Indicates a type of tire,
designated by the Tire and Rim
Association, that is intended for
temporary service on cars,
sport-utility vehicles, minivans and
light trucks.
B. 145: Indicates the nominal
width of the tire in millimeters
from sidewall edge to sidewall
edge. In general, the larger the
number, the wider the tire.
C. 80: Indicates the aspect ratio
which gives the tire's ratio of
height to width. Numbers of 70 or
lower indicate a short sidewall.
D. D: Indicates a diagonal type tire.
R: Indicates a radial type tire.
E. 16: Indicates the wheel or rim
diameter in inches. If you change
your wheel size, you will have to
purchase new tires to match the
new wheel diameter.
Location of the Tire Label
You will find a Tire Label
containing tire inflation pressure
by tire size and other important
information located on the B-Pillar
or the edge of the driver door.
Inflating Your Tires
Safe operation of your vehicle
requires that your tires are
properly inflated. Remember that
a tire can lose up to half of its air
pressure without appearing flat.
Every day before you drive, check
your tires. If one looks lower than
the others, use a tire gauge to
check pressure of all tires and
adjust if required.
At least once a month and before
long trips, inspect each tire and
check the tire pressure with a tire
gauge (including spare, if
equipped). Inflate all tires to the
inflation pressure recommended
by Ford Motor Company.
WARNING: Under-inflation
is the most common cause of
tire failures and may result in
severe tire cracking, tread
separation or blowout, with
unexpected loss of vehicle
262
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Wheels and Tires
control and increased risk of
injury. Under-inflation increases
sidewall flexing and rolling
resistance, resulting in heat
buildup and internal damage to
the tire. It also may result in
unnecessary tire stress, irregular
wear, loss of vehicle control and
accidents. A tire can lose up to
half of its air pressure and not
appear to be flat!
You are strongly urged to buy a
reliable tire pressure gauge, as
automatic service station gauges
may be inaccurate. Ford
recommends the use of a digital
or dial-type tire pressure gauge
rather than a stick-type tire
pressure gauge.
Use the recommended cold
inflation pressure for optimum tire
performance and wear.
Under-inflation or over-inflation
may cause uneven treadwear
patterns.
Always inflate your tires to the
Ford recommended inflation
pressure even if it is less than the
maximum inflation pressure
information found on the tire. The
Ford recommended tire inflation
pressure is found on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position), or Tire Label which is
located on the B-Pillar or the edge
of the driver door. Failure to follow
the tire pressure
recommendations can cause
uneven treadwear patterns and
adversely affect the way your
vehicle handles.
Maximum Inflation Pressure is
the tire manufacturer's maximum
permissible pressure or the
pressure at which the maximum
load can be carried by the tire. This
pressure is normally higher than
the manufacturer’s recommended
cold inflation pressure, which can
be found on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position), or Tire Label which is
located on the B-Pillar or the edge
of the driver’s door. The cold
inflation pressure should never be
set lower than the recommended
pressure on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label or
Tire Label.
When weather temperature
changes occur, tire inflation
pressures also change. A 10°F
(6°C) temperature drop can
cause a corresponding drop of
1 psi (7 kPa) in inflation pressure.
Check your tire pressures
frequently and adjust them to the
proper pressure which can be
found on the Safety Compliance
Certification Label or Tire Label.
To check the pressure in your
tire(s):
263
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Wheels and Tires
1. Make sure the tires are cool,
meaning they are not hot from
driving even a mile.
Note: If you are checking tire
pressure when the tire is hot, (for
example, driven more than 1 mile
[1.6 kilometers], never bleed or
reduce air pressure. The tires are
hot from driving and it is normal for
pressures to increase above
recommended cold pressures. A
hot tire at or below recommended
cold inflation pressure could be
significantly under-inflated.
Note: If you have to drive a
distance to get air for your tire(s),
check and record the tire pressure
first and add the appropriate air
pressure when you get to the
pump. It is normal for tires to heat
up and the air pressure inside to go
up as you drive.
2. Remove the cap from the valve
on one tire, then firmly press the
tire gauge onto the valve and
measure the pressure.
3. Add enough air to reach the
recommended air pressure.
Note: If you overfill the tire, release
air by pressing on the metal stem
in the center of the valve. Then
recheck the pressure with your tire
gauge.
4. Replace the valve cap.
5. Repeat this procedure for each
tire, including the spare.
Note: Some spare tires operate at
a higher inflation pressure than the
other tires. For T-type mini-spare
tires, refer to the Dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly
information for a description. Store
and maintain at 60 psi (4.15 bar).
For full-size and dissimilar spare
tires, refer to the Dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly
information for a description. Store
and maintain at the higher of the
front and rear inflation pressure as
shown on the Tire Label.
6. Visually inspect the tires to
make sure there are no nails or
other objects embedded that
could poke a hole in the tire and
cause an air leak.
7. Check the sidewalls to make
sure there are no gouges, cuts or
bulges.
Inspecting Your Tires and
Wheel Valve Stems
Periodically inspect the tire treads
for uneven or excessive wear and
remove objects such as stones,
nails or glass that may be wedged
in the tread grooves. Check the tire
and valve stems for holes, cracks,
or cuts that may permit air
leakage and repair or replace the
tire and replace the valve stem.
Inspect the tire sidewalls for
cracking, cuts, bruises and other
signs of damage or excessive
wear. If internal damage to the tire
is suspected, have the tire
demounted and inspected in case
264
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Wheels and Tires
it needs to be repaired or replaced.
For your safety, tires that are
damaged or show signs of
excessive wear should not be used
because they are more likely to
blow out or fail.
Improper or inadequate vehicle
maintenance can cause tires to
wear abnormally. Inspect all your
tires, including the spare,
frequently, and replace them if
one or more of the following
conditions exist:
Tire Wear
When the tread is worn down to
1/16th of an inch (2 mm), tires
must be replaced to help prevent
your vehicle from skidding and
hydroplaning. Built-in treadwear
indicators, or wear bars, which
look like narrow strips of smooth
rubber across the tread will
appear on the tire when the tread
is worn down to 1/16th of an inch
(2 mm).
When the tire tread wears down
to the same height as these wear
bars, the tire is worn out and must
be replaced.
Damage
Periodically inspect the tire treads
and sidewalls for damage (such
as bulges in the tread or sidewalls,
cracks in the tread groove and
separation in the tread or
sidewall). If damage is observed
or suspected have the tire
inspected by a tire professional.
Tires can be damaged during
off-road use, so inspection after
off-road use is also
recommended.
Age
WARNING: Tires degrade
over time depending on many
factors such as weather, storage
conditions, and conditions of use
(load, speed, inflation pressure)
the tires experience throughout
their lives.
In general, tires should be
replaced after six years
regardless of tread wear.
However, heat caused by hot
climates or frequent high loading
conditions can accelerate the
aging process and may require
tires to be replaced more
frequently.
265

Wheels and Tires
You should replace your spare
tire when you replace the road
tires or after six years due to
aging even if it has not been
used.
U.S. DOT Tire Identification
Number
Both United States and Canada
Federal regulations require tire
manufacturers to place
standardized information on the
sidewall of all tires. This
information identifies and
describes the fundamental
characteristics of the tire and also
provides a United States DOT Tire
Identification Number for safety
standard certification and in case
of a recall.
This begins with the letters DOT
and indicates that the tire meets
all federal standards. The next
two numbers or letters are the
plant code designating where it
was manufactured, the next two
are the tire size code and the last
four numbers represent the week
and year the tire was built. For
example, the numbers 317 mean
the 31st week of 1997. After 2000
the numbers go to four digits. For
example, 2501 means the 25th
week of 2001. The numbers in
between are identification codes
used for traceability. This
information is used to contact
customers if a tire defect requires
a recall.
Tire Replacement
Requirements
Your vehicle is equipped with tires
designed to provide a safe ride
and handling capability.
WARNING: Only use
replacement tires and wheels
that are the same size, load
index, speed rating and type
(such as P-metric versus
LT-metric or all-season versus
all-terrain) as those originally
provided by Ford. The
recommended tire and wheel
size may be found on either the
Safety Compliance Certification
Label (affixed to either the door
hinge pillar, door-latch post, or
the door edge that meets the
door-latch post, next to the
driver's seating position), or the
Tire Label which is located on
the B-Pillar or edge of the
driver's door. If this information
is not found on these labels, then
you should contact your
authorized dealer as soon as
possible. Use of any tire or wheel
not recommended by Ford can
affect the safety and
performance of your vehicle,
which could result in an
increased risk of loss of vehicle
control, vehicle rollover, personal
injury and death.
266
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Wheels and Tires
WARNING: To reduce the
risk of serious injury, when
mounting replacement tires and
wheels, you should not exceed
the maximum pressure indicated
on the sidewall of the tire to set
the beads without additional
precautions listed below. If the
beads do not seat at the
maximum pressure indicated,
re-lubricate and try again.
WARNING: When inflating
the tire for mounting pressures
up to 20 psi (1.38 bar) greater
than the maximum pressure on
the tire sidewall, the following
precautions must be taken to
protect the person mounting the
tire:
•
Make sure that you have the
correct tire and wheel size.
•
Lubricate the tire bead and
wheel bead seat area again.
•
Stand at a minimum of 12 ft
(3.66 m) away from the wheel
and tire assembly.
•
Use both eye and ear
protection.
WARNING: For a mounting
pressure more than 20 psi
(1.38 bar) greater than the
maximum pressure, a Ford
dealer or other tire service
professional should do the
mounting.
WARNING: Always inflate
steel carcass tires with a remote
air fill with the person inflating
standing at a minimum of 12 ft
(3.66 m) away from the wheel
and tire assembly.
Important: Remember to replace
the wheel valve stems when the
road tires are replaced on your
vehicle.
It is recommended that the two
front tires or two rear tires
generally be replaced as a pair.
The tire pressure sensors mounted
in the wheels (originally installed
on your vehicle) are not designed
to be used in aftermarket wheels.
The use of wheels or tires not
recommended by Ford Motor
Company may affect the
operation of your tire pressure
monitoring system.
If the tire pressure monitoring
system indicator is flashing, your
tire pressure monitoring system is
malfunctioning. Your replacement
tire might be incompatible with
your TPMS, or some component
of the TPMS may be damaged.

Wheels and Tires
Safety Practices
WARNING: If your vehicle
is stuck in snow, mud or sand, do
not rapidly spin the tires;
spinning the tires can tear the
tire and cause an explosion. A
tire can explode in as little as
three to five seconds.
WARNING: Do not spin the
wheels at over 34 mph
(55 km/h). The tires may fail and
injure a passenger or bystander.
Driving habits have a great deal
to do with your tire mileage and
safety.
Observe posted speed limits.
Avoid fast starts, stops and turns.
Avoid potholes and objects on the
road.
Do not run over curbs or hit the tire
against a curb when parking.
Highway Hazards
No matter how carefully you drive
there is always the possibility that
you may eventually have a flat tire
on the highway. Drive slowly to the
closest safe area out of traffic.
This may further damage the flat
tire, but your safety is more
important.
If you feel a sudden vibration or
ride disturbance while driving, or
you suspect your tire or vehicle
has been damaged, immediately
reduce your speed. Drive with
caution until you can safely pull
off the road. Stop and inspect the
tires for damage.
If a tire is under-inflated, check the
tire for damage. If the tire is not
damaged, inflate it to the
recommended tire pressure.
If a tire is damaged, have it
replaced immediately. If your
vehicle has a spare wheel, fit the
spare wheel immediately and
have the damaged tire replaced
as soon as possible. If your vehicle
does not have a spare wheel, it
has a temporary mobility kit.
Tire and Wheel Alignment
A bad jolt from hitting a curb or
pothole can cause the front end
of your vehicle to become
misaligned or cause damage to
your tires. If your vehicle seems to
pull to one side when you are
driving, the wheels may be out of
alignment. Have an authorized
dealer check the wheel alignment
periodically.
268
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Wheels and Tires
Wheel misalignment in the front
or the rear can cause uneven and
rapid treadwear of your tires and
should be corrected by an
authorized dealer. Front-wheel
drive vehicles and those with an
independent rear suspension (if
equipped) may require alignment
of all four wheels.
The tires should also be balanced
periodically. An unbalanced tire
and wheel assembly may result in
irregular tire wear.
Tire Rotation
WARNING: If the tire label
shows different tire pressures for
the front and rear tires and the
vehicle has a tire pressure
monitoring system, then you
need to update the settings for
the system sensors. Always
perform the system reset
procedure after tire rotation. If
you do not reset the system, it
may not provide a low tire
pressure warning when
necessary.
Note: If your tires show uneven
wear ask an authorized dealer to
check for and correct any wheel
misalignment, tire imbalance or
mechanical problem involved
before tire rotation.
Note: Your vehicle may be
equipped with a dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly. A
dissimilar spare wheel and tire
assembly is defined as a spare
wheel and tire assembly that is
different in brand, size or
appearance from the road tires and
wheels. If you have a dissimilar
spare wheel and tire assembly it is
intended for temporary use only
and should not be used in a tire
rotation.
Note: After having your tires
rotated, inflation pressure must be
checked and adjusted to the
vehicle requirements.
Rotating your tires at the
recommended interval (as
indicated in the Scheduled
Maintenance chapter) will help
your tires wear more evenly,
providing better tire performance
and longer tire life.
Front-wheel drive vehicles (front
tires on the left side of the
diagram).
269

Wheels and Tires
Sometimes irregular tire wear can
be corrected by rotating the tires.
USING SUMMER TIRES
Summer tires provide superior
performance on wet and dry roads.
Summer tires do not have the Mud and
Snow (M+S or M/S) tire traction rating on
the tire side wall. Since summer tires do
not have the same traction performance
as All-season or Snow tires, we do not
recommend using summer tires when
temperatures drop to about 45°F (7°C) or
below (depending on tire wear and
environmental conditions) or in snow and
ice conditions. Like any tire, summer tire
performance is affected by tire wear and
environmental conditions. If you must drive
in those conditions, we recommend using
Mud and Snow (M+S, M/S), All-season or
Snow tires.
Always store your summer tires indoors at
temperatures above 19°F (-7°C). The
rubber compounds used in these tires lose
flexibility and may develop surface cracks
in the tread area at temperatures below
19°F (-7°C). If the tires have been
subjected to 19°F (-7°C) or less, warm
them in a heated space to at least 41°F
(5°C) for at least 24 hours before installing
them on a vehicle, or moving the vehicle
with the tires installed, or checking tire
inflation. Do not place tires near heaters
or heating devices used to warm the room
where the tires are stored. Do not apply
heat or blow heated air directly on the tires.
Always inspect the tires after storage
periods and before use.
USING SNOW CHAINS
WARNING: Snow tires must be
the same size, load index and speed
rating as those originally provided by
Ford. Use of any tire or wheel not
recommended by Ford can affect the
safety and performance of your vehicle,
which could result in an increased risk of
loss of control, vehicle rollover, personal
injury and death. Additionally, the use of
non-recommended tires and wheels can
cause steering, suspension, axle, transfer
case or power transfer unit failure.
Follow the Ford recommended tire
inflation pressure found on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label (on the
door hinge pillar, door latch post or the
door edge that meets the door latch
post, next to the driver seat), or Tire
Label on the B-Pillar or the edge of the
driver door. Failure to follow the tire
pressure recommendations can cause
uneven treadwear patterns and
adversely affect the way your vehicle
handles.

Wheels and Tires
The tires on your vehicle may have
all-weather treads to provide traction in
rain and snow. However, in some climates
you may need to use snow chains. If you
need to use chains, it is recommended that
steel wheels (of the same size and
specification) be used, as chains may chip
aluminum wheels. Follow these guidelines
when using traction devices:
•
Use 0.3937 in (10 mm) or less in
dimension as measured on the sidewall
of your tire with 205/60 R16 92H or
205/50 R17 93H XL. Not all S-class
snow chains meet these restrictions.
Chains of this size restriction will
include a tensioning device. (Any
Lincoln or Ford passenger vehicle).
•
The snow chains or cables must be
mounted in pairs on only on the front
axle.
•
Purchase chains or cables from a
manufacturer that clearly labels body
to tire dimension restrictions.
•
When installing tire chains or cables,
make sure they are the proper size for
the tires on your vehicle and are
installed according to the chain
manufacturer’s suggestions.
•
Install cables securely, verifying that
the cables do not extend beyond the
wheel or touch the wheel, any wiring,
brake lining.
•
If possible, avoid fully loading your
vehicle.
•
When driving with snow chains or
cables, do not exceed 30 mph
(48 km/h) or the maximum speed
recommended by the chain
manufacturer; whichever is less.
•
Drive cautiously. If you hear the chains
or cables rub or bang against the
vehicle, stop and retighten them. If this
does not work, remove the chains or
cables and prevent vehicle damage.
•
Remove the chains or cables when they
are no longer needed. Do not use the
chains or cables on dry roads.
•
If a temporary spare tire is mounted on
your vehicle, do not use snow chains
on the axle with the temporary spare
tire.
If you have any questions regarding snow
tires or snow chains, please contact your
authorized dealer.
TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM
WARNING: The tire pressure
monitoring system is not a substitute for
manually checking tire pressures. You
should periodically check tire pressures
using a pressure gauge. Failure to
correctly maintain tire pressures could
increase the risk of tire failure, loss of
control, vehicle rollover and personal
injury.
Note:  You should only use tire sealants in
roadside emergencies as they could cause
damage to the tire pressure monitoring
system sensor.
Note:  If the tire pressure monitoring system
sensor becomes damaged, it will not
function.
Each tire, including the spare (if
provided), should be checked
monthly when cold and inflated
to the inflation pressure recommended by
the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle
placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If
your vehicle has tires of a different size
than the size indicated on the vehicle
placard or tire inflation pressure label, you
should determine the proper tire inflation
pressure for those tires).

Wheels and Tires
As an added safety feature, your vehicle
has been equipped with a Tire Pressure
Monitoring System (TPMS) that
illuminates a low tire pressure telltale
when one or more of your tires is
significantly under-inflated. Accordingly,
when the low tire pressure telltale
illuminates, you should stop and check
your tires as soon as possible, and inflate
them to the proper pressure. Driving on a
significantly under-inflated tire causes the
tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure.
Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency
and tire tread life, and could affect the
vehicle’s handling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS is not a
substitute for proper tire maintenance, and
it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain
correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation
has not reached the level to trigger
illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure
telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with
a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate
when the system is not operating properly.
The TPMS malfunction indicator is
combined with the low tire pressure
telltale. When the system detects a
malfunction, the telltale will flash for
approximately one minute and then remain
continuously illuminated. This sequence
will continue upon subsequent vehicle
start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.
When the malfunction indicator is
illuminated, the system will not be able to
detect or signal low tire pressure as
intended. TPMS malfunctions could occur
for a variety of reasons, including the
installation of replacement or alternate
tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent
the TPMS from functioning properly.
Always check the TPMS malfunction
telltale after replacing one or more tires or
wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the
replacement or alternate tires and wheels
allow the TPMS to continue to function
properly.
This device complies with Part 15 of the
FCC Rules and with License exempt RSS
Standards of Industry Canada. Operation
is subject to the following two conditions:
1.
This device will not cause harmful
interference, and
2.
This device must accept any
interference received, including
interference that could cause
undesired operation.
Note: Changes or modifications not
expressively approved by the party
responsible for compliance could void the
user's authority to operate the equipment.
The term "IC:" before the radio certification
number only signifies that Industry Canada
technical specifications were met.
Changing Tires With a Tire
Pressure Monitoring System
Note: Each road tire is equipped with a tire
pressure sensor located inside the wheel
and tire assembly cavity. The pressure
sensor is attached to the valve stem. The
pressure sensor is covered by the tire and is
not visible unless the tire is removed. Take
care when changing the tire to avoid
damaging the sensor.
You should always have your tires serviced
by an authorized dealer.

Wheels and Tires
Check the tire pressure periodically (at
least monthly) using an accurate tire
gauge. See When Inflating Your Tires in
this chapter.
Understanding Your Tire Pressure
Monitoring System
The tire pressure monitoring system
measures pressure in your road tires and
sends the tire pressure readings to your
vehicle. You can view the tire pressure
readings through the information display.
See General Information (page 93). The
low tire pressure warning light will turn on
if the tire pressure is significantly low. Once
the light is illuminated, your tires are
under-inflated and need to be inflated to
the manufacturer’s recommended tire
pressure. Even if the light turns on and a
short time later turns off, your tire pressure
still needs to be checked.
When Your Temporary Spare Tire is
Installed
When one of your road tires needs to be
replaced with the temporary spare, the
system will continue to identify an issue to
remind you that the damaged road wheel
and tire assembly needs to be repaired and
put back on your vehicle.
To restore the full function of the tire
pressure monitoring system, have the
damaged road wheel and tire assembly
repaired and remounted on your vehicle.
When You Believe Your System is Not
Operating Properly
The main function of the tire pressure
monitoring system is to warn you when
your tires need air. It can also warn you in
the event the system is no longer capable
of functioning as intended. See the
following chart for information concerning
your tire pressure monitoring system:

When Inflating Your Tires
WARNING: Do not use the tire
pressure displayed in the information
display as a tire pressure gauge. Failure
to follow this instruction could result in
personal injury or death.
When putting air into your tires (such as at
a gas station or in your garage), the tire
pressure monitoring system will not
respond immediately to the air added to
your tires.
It could take up to two minutes of driving
over 20 mph (32 km/h) for the light to turn
off after you have filled your tires to the
recommended inflation pressure.
How Temperature Affects Your Tire
Pressure
The tire pressure monitoring system
monitors tire pressure in each pneumatic
tire. While driving in a normal manner, a
typical passenger tire inflation pressure
could increase about 2–4 psi (14–28 kPa)
from a cold start situation. If the vehicle is
stationary overnight with the outside
temperature significantly lower than the
daytime temperature, the tire pressure
could decrease about 3 psi (21 kPa) for a
drop of 30°F (17°C) in ambient
temperature. This lower pressure value
could be detected by the tire pressure
monitoring system as being significantly
lower than the recommended inflation
pressure and activate the system warning
light for low tire pressure. If the low tire
pressure warning light is on, visually check
each tire to verify that no tire is flat. If one
or more tires are flat, repair as necessary.
Check the air pressure in the road tires. If
any tire is under-inflated, carefully drive
the vehicle to the nearest location where
air can be added to the tires. Inflate all the
tires to the recommended inflation
pressure.
Tire Pressure Monitoring System Reset
Procedure
WARNING: To determine the
required pressure(s) for your vehicle, see
the Safety Compliance Certification
Label (on the door hinge pillar,
door-latch post or the door edge that
meets the door-latch post, next to the
driver seat) or the Tire Label on the
B-Pillar or the edge of the driver door.
Note: You need to perform the tire pressure
monitoring system reset procedure after
each tire rotation.
To provide the vehicle's load carrying
capability, some vehicles require different
recommended tire pressures in the front
tires as compared to the rear tires. The tire
pressure monitoring system equipped on
these vehicles is designed to illuminate the
low tire pressure warning light at two
different pressures; one for the front tires
and one for the rear tires.
Since tires need to be rotated to provide
consistent performance and maximum tire
life, the tire pressure monitoring system
needs to know when the tires are rotated
to determine which set of tires are on the
front and which are on the rear. With this
information, the system can detect and
properly warn of low tire pressures.

•
To reduce the chances of interference
from another vehicle, perform the
system reset procedure at least 3 ft
(1 m) away from another Ford Motor
Company vehicle undergoing the
system reset procedure at the same
time.
•
Do not wait more than two minutes
between resetting each tire sensor or
the system can time-out and you have
to repeat the entire procedure on all
four wheels.
•
A double horn sounds indicating the
need to repeat the procedure.
Performing the System Reset Procedure
Read the entire procedure before
attempting.
1.
Drive the vehicle above 20 mph
(32 km/h) for at least two minutes,
then park in a safe location where you
can easily get to all four tires and have
access to an air pump.
2.
Place the ignition in the off position and
keep the key in the ignition.
3.
Cycle the ignition to the on position
with the engine off.
4.
Turn the hazard flashers on then off
three times. You must accomplish this
within 10 seconds. If you successfully
enter the reset mode, the horn sounds
once, the system indicator flashes and
a message shows in the information
display. If this does not occur, please
try again starting at step 2. If after
repeated attempts to enter the reset
mode, the horn does not sound, the
system indicator does not flash and no
message shows in the information
display, seek service from your
authorized dealer.
5.
Train the tire pressure monitoring
system sensors in the tires using the
following system reset sequence
starting with the left front tire in the
following clockwise order: Left front -
driver side front tire, Right front -
passenger side front tire, Right rear -
passenger side rear tire, Left rear -
driver side rear tire.
6.
Remove the valve cap from the valve
stem on the left front tire. Decrease the
air pressure until the horn sounds.
Note: The single horn tone confirms that
the sensor identification code has been
learned by the module for this position. If a
double horn is heard, the reset procedure
was unsuccessful, and you must repeat it.
7.
Remove the valve cap from the valve
stem on the right front tire. Decrease
the air pressure until the horn sounds.
8.
Remove the valve cap from the valve
stem on the right rear tire. Decrease the
air pressure until the horn sounds.
9.
Remove the valve cap from the valve
stem on the left rear tire. Decrease the
air pressure until the horn sounds.
Training is complete after the horn
sounds for the last tire trained, driver
side rear tire, the system indicator
stops flashing, and a message shows
in the information display.
10.
Turn the ignition off. If two short horn
beeps are heard, the reset procedure
was unsuccessful and you must
repeat it. If after repeating the
procedure and two short beeps are
heard when the ignition is turned to
off, seek assistance from your
authorized dealer.

Capacities and Specifications
We recommend Motorcraft® motor oil for
your vehicle.  If Motorcraft® oil is not
available, use motor oils of the
recommended viscosity grade that meet
API SN requirements and display the API
Certification Mark for gasoline engines.  Do
not use oil labeled with API SN service
category unless the label also displays the
API certification mark.
Note: Do not use more than 1.1 qt (1 L) of
the alternative engine oil between
scheduled service intervals.
If you do not use oil and fluid that meets
the defined specification and viscosity
grade, it could result in:
•
Component damage that your vehicle
warranty does not cover.
•
Longer engine cranking periods.
•
Increased emission levels.
•
Reduced engine performance.
•
Reduced fuel economy.
•
Reduced brake performance.
Do not use supplemental engine oil
additives because they are unnecessary
and could lead to engine damage that may
not be covered by the vehicle Warranty.
Alternative Engine Oil for
Extremely Cold Climates
To improve engine cold start performance,
we recommend that you use the following
alternative engine oil in extremely cold
climates, where the ambient temperature
reaches -22.0°F (-30°C) or below.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Radio Frequencies and Reception Factors
Radio Reception Factors
The further you travel away from an FM station, the weaker
the signal and the weaker the reception.
Distance and Strength
Hills, mountains, tall buildings, bridges, tunnels, freeway
overpasses, parking garages, dense tree foliage and
thunderstorms can interfere with the reception.
Terrain
When you pass near a radio transmission tower, a stronger
signal can override a weaker signal and can cause interfer-
ence in the audio system.
Station overload
MP3 and WMA Track and Folder
Structure
Audio systems capable of recognizing and
playing MP3 and WMA individual tracks
and folder structures work as follows:
•
There are two different modes for MP3
and WMA disc playback: MP3 and
WMA track mode (system default) and
MP3 and WMA folder mode.
•
MP3 and WMA track mode ignores any
folder structure on the MP3 and WMA
disc. The player numbers each MP3
and WMA track on the disc (noted by
the .mp3 or .WMA file extension) from
T001 to a maximum of T255.

Safety Information
WARNING: Driving while
distracted can result in loss of vehicle
control, crash and injury. We strongly
recommend that you use extreme
caution when using any device that may
take your focus off the road. Your
primary responsibility is the safe
operation of your vehicle. We
recommend against the use of any
hand-held device while driving and
encourage the use of voice-operated
systems when possible. Make sure you
are aware of all applicable local laws
that may affect the use of electronic
devices while driving.
When using SYNC:
•
Do not operate playing devices if the
power cords or cables are broken, split
or damaged. Place cords and cables
out of the way, so they do not interfere
with the operation of pedals, seats,
compartments or safe driving abilities.
•
Do not leave playing devices in your
vehicle during extreme conditions as it
could cause them damage. See your
device's manual for further information.
•
Do not attempt to service or repair the
system.  See an authorized dealer.
Privacy Information
When a cellular phone is connected to
SYNC, the system creates a profile within
your vehicle that is linked to that cellular
phone. This profile is created in order to
offer you more cellular features and to
operate more efficiently. Among other
302
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing

things, this profile may contain data about
your cellular phone book, text messages
(read and unread), and call history,
including history of calls when your cellular
phone was not connected to the system.
In addition, if you connect a media device,
the system creates and retains an index of
supported media content. The system also
records a short development log of
approximately 10 minutes of all recent
system activity. The log profile and other
system data may be used to improve the
system and help diagnose any problems
that may occur.
The cellular profile, media device index,
and development log will remain in the
vehicle unless you delete them and are
generally accessible only in the vehicle
when you connect the cellular phone or
media player. If you no longer plan to use
the system or the vehicle, we recommend
you perform a Master Reset to erase all
stored information.
No one can access system data without
special equipment and access to the
vehicle's SYNC module. Ford Motor
Company and Ford of Canada will not
access the system data for any purpose
other than as described absent consent, a
court order, or where required by law
enforcement, other government
authorities, or other third parties acting
with lawful authority. Other parties may
seek to access the information
independently of Ford Motor Company and
Ford of Canada. For further privacy
information, see the section on 911 Assist.
See SYNC™ Applications and Services

Helpful Hints
•
Make sure the interior of your vehicle is
as quiet as possible. Wind noise from
open windows and road vibrations may
prevent the system from correctly
recognizing spoken commands.
•
Before giving a voice command, wait
for the system announcement to finish,
followed by a single tone. Any
command spoken before this does not
register with the system.
•
Speak naturally, without long pauses
between words.
•
You can interrupt the system at any
time while it is speaking by pressing the
voice button. You can cancel a voice
session by pressing and holding the
voice button.
System Interaction and Feedback
The system provides feedback through
audible tones, prompts, questions and
spoken confirmations depending on the
situation and the chosen level of
interaction. You can customize the voice
recognition system to provide more or less
instruction and feedback.

SYNC™
WARNING: Always place your
phone in a secure location in your vehicle
so it does not become a projectile or get
damaged in a crash. Failure to do so may
cause serious injury to someone or
damage the phone which could prevent
911 Assist from working properly.
Note: The SYNC 911 Assist feature must be
set on before the incident.
Note: The SYNC 911 Assist feature only
operates in the U.S., Canada or in a territory
in which 911 is the emergency number.
Note: Before setting this feature on, make
sure that you read the 911 Assist Privacy
Notice later in this section for important
information.
Note: If any user switches 911 Assist to on
or off, that setting applies for all paired
phones. If 911 Assist is switched off, either
a voice message plays or a display message
or an icon comes on when your vehicle is
started and after a previously paired phone
connects.
Note: Every phone operates differently.
While SYNC 911 Assist works with most
cellular phones, some may have trouble
using this feature.
If a crash deploys an airbag (excluding
knee airbags and rear inflatable safety
belts [if equipped]) or activates the fuel
pump shut-off, your SYNC-equipped
vehicle may be able to contact emergency
services by dialing 911 through a paired and
connected Bluetooth-enabled phone.
See SYNC™ (page 302).  Important
information about airbag deployment is in
this chapter.
See Roadside Emergencies (page 190).
Important information about the fuel pump
shut-off is in this chapter.
Setting 911 Assist On or Off
Press the Settings button then select:
Action and Description
Menu
Item
Select the desired option, on
or off.
911 Assist
To make sure that 911 Assist works
properly:
•
SYNC must be powered and working
properly at the time of the incident and
throughout feature activation and use.
•
The 911 Assist feature must be set on
before the incident.
•
You must pair and connect a Bluetooth
enabled and compatible cell phone to
SYNC.
•
A connected Bluetooth enabled phone
must have the ability to make and
maintain an outgoing call at the time
of the incident.
•
A connected Bluetooth enabled phone
must have adequate network coverage,
battery power and signal strength.
•
The vehicle must have battery power
and be located in the U.S., Canada or
in a territory in which 911 is the
emergency number.
In the Event of a Crash
Not all crashes deploy an airbag or activate
the fuel pump shut-off (the triggers for 911
Assist). If a connected cell phone sustains
damage or loses its connection to SYNC
during a crash, SYNC searches for and tries
to connect to a previously paired cell
phone; SYNC then attempts to call the
emergency services.

SYNC™
Before making the call:
•
SYNC provides a short window of time
(about 10 seconds) to cancel the call.
If you fail to cancel the call, SYNC
attempts to dial 911.
•
SYNC says the following, or a similar
message: "SYNC will attempt to call
911, to cancel the call, press Cancel on
your screen or press and hold the
phone button on your steering wheel".
If you do not cancel the call, and SYNC
makes a successful call, a pre-recorded
message plays for the 911 operator, and
then the occupant(s) in your vehicle are
able to talk with the operator. Be prepared
to provide your name, phone number and
location immediately, because not all 911
systems are capable of receiving this
information electronically.
911 Assist May Not Work If
•
Your cellular phone or 911 Assist
hardware sustains damage in a crash.
•
The vehicle's battery or the SYNC
system has no power.
•
The phone(s) thrown from your vehicle
are the ones paired and connected to
the system.
911 Assist Privacy Notice
When you switch on 911 Assist, it may
disclose to emergency services that your
vehicle has been in a crash involving the
deployment of an airbag or activation of
the fuel pump shut-off. Certain versions or
updates to 911 Assist may also be capable
of electronically or verbally disclosing to
911 operators your vehicle location or other
details about your vehicle or crash to assist
911 operators to provide the most
appropriate emergency services. If you do
not want to disclose this information, do
not switch the feature on.
SYNC Mobile Apps
The system enables voice and steering
wheel control of SYNC AppLink enabled
smartphone apps.  When an app is running
through AppLink, you can control main
features of the app through voice
commands and steering wheel controls.
Note: You must pair and connect your
smartphone to SYNC to access AppLink.
Note: Android users need to connect the
phone to SYNC using Bluetooth.

•
To allow the app to send push
notifications using the vehicle display
and voice capabilities while running in
a background state. Push notifications
may be particularly useful for news or
location based apps.
Note: You only need to grant permissions
the first time you use an app with SYNC.
Note: Ford is not responsible or liable for
any damages or loss of privacy relating to
usage of an app, or dissemination of any
vehicle data that you approve Ford to
provide to an app.

Privacy Information
When you connect a cellular phone to
SYNC 3, the system creates a profile within
your vehicle that links to that cellular
phone. This profile helps in offering you
more cellular features and operating more
efficiently. Among other things, this profile
may contain data about your cellular
phone book, text messages (read and
unread), and call history, including history
of calls when your cell phone was not
connected to the system. In addition, if you
connect a media device, the system
creates and retains an index of supported
media content. The system also records a
short diagnostic log of approximately 10
minutes of all recent system activity. The
log profile and other system data may be
used to improve the system and help
diagnose any problems that may occur.
The cellular profile, media device index,
and diagnostic log remain in your vehicle
unless you delete them and are generally
accessible only in your vehicle when the
cellular phone or media player is
connected.
If you sell or transfer your vehicle, we
recommend you perform a Master Reset
to erase all stored information. You can
find more information about the Master
Reset in General Settings.  See Settings
(page 355).  System data cannot be
accessed without special equipment and
access to your vehicle's SYNC 3 module.
Ford Motor Company and Ford of Canada
do not access the system data for any
purpose other than as described absent
consent, a court order, or where required
by law enforcement, other government
authorities, or other third parties acting
with lawful authority. Other parties may
seek to access the information
independently of Ford Motor Company and
Ford of Canada.

SYNC™ 3
HD Radio technology is the digital
evolution of analog AM/FM radio. Your
system has a special receiver that allows
it to receive digital broadcasts (where
available) in addition to the analog
broadcasts, it already receives. Digital
broadcasts provide a better sound quality
than analog broadcasts with free,
crystal-clear audio and no static or
distortion. For more information, and a
guide to available stations and
programming, please visit:
Website
www.hdradio.com
When HD Radio is on and you tune to a
station broadcasting HD Radio technology,
you may notice the following indicators on
your screen:
The HD logo is grey when acquiring a digital
station, and then changes to orange when
digital audio is playing. When this logo is
available, you may also see Title and Artist
fields on-screen.
The multicast indicator appears in FM
mode (only) if the current station is
broadcasting multiple digital broadcasts.
The highlighted numbers signify available
digital channels where new or different
content is available. HD1 signifies the main
programming status and is available in
analog and digital broadcasts. Other
multicast stations (HD2 through HD7) are
only available digitally.
Note:  There is also an additional feature
for stations that have more than 1 HD
multicast (For example, HD1 or HD2). The
HD logo and Radio text appears as a button.
Pressing this button allows you cycle
through all of the HD stations on that
specific frequency. For example, if you are
on 101.1 and it has HD1, HD2, HD3, pressing
the button repeatedly causes the radio to
cycle through the HD stations in a cyclic
increasing order.
When HD Radio broadcasts are active, you can access the following functions:
Action and description
Message
Allows you to save an active channel as a memory preset.
Touch and hold a memory preset slot until the sound returns.
There is a brief mute while the radio saves the station. Sound
returns when the channel saves. When switching to an HD2
or HD3 memory preset, the sound mutes before the digital
audio plays, because the system has to reacquire the digital
signal.
Presets
Note: As with any station you save, you cannot access the saved station if your vehicle is
outside the station’s reception area.

SYNC™ 3
HD Radio Reception and Station Troubleshooting
Potential reception issues
If you are listening to a multicast station and you are on the
fringe of the reception area, the station may mute due to
weak signal strength.
Reception area
If you are listening to HD1, the system changes back to the
analog broadcast until the digital broadcast is available again.
However, if you are listening to any of the possible HD2-HD7
multicast channels, the station mutes and stays muted unless
it is able to connect to the digital signal again.
When the system first receives a station (aside from HD2-
HD7 multicast stations), it first plays the station in the analog
version. Once the receiver verifies the station is an HD Radio
station, it shifts to the digital version. Depending on the station
quality, you may hear a slight sound change when the station
changes from analog to digital. Blending is the shift from
analog to digital sound or digital back to analog sound.
Station blending
In order to provide the best possible
experience, use the contact form to report
any station issues found while listening to
a station broadcasting with HD Radio
technology. Independent entities own and
operate each station. These stations are
responsible for ensuring all audio streams
and data fields are accurate.

GENERAL MAINTENANCE
INFORMATION
Why Maintain Your Vehicle?
Carefully following the maintenance
schedule helps protect against major repair
expenses resulting from neglect or
inadequate maintenance and may help to
increase the value of your vehicle when
you sell or trade it. Keep all receipts for
completed maintenance with your vehicle.
We have established regular maintenance
intervals for your vehicle based upon
rigorous testing. It is important that you
have your vehicle serviced at the proper
times. These intervals serve two purposes;
one is to maintain the reliability of your
vehicle and the second is to keep your cost
of owning your vehicle down.
It is your responsibility to have all
scheduled maintenance performed and to
make sure that the materials used meet
the specifications identified in this owner's
manual.  See Scheduled Maintenance
(page 373).
Failure to perform scheduled maintenance
invalidates warranty coverage on parts
affected by the lack of maintenance.
Why Maintain Your Vehicle at Your
Dealership?
Factory-Trained Technicians
Service technicians participate in extensive
factory-sponsored certification training to
help them become experts on the
operation of your vehicle. Ask your
dealership about the training and
certification their technicians have
received.
Genuine Ford and Motorcraft
Replacement Parts
Dealerships stock Ford, Motorcraft and
Ford-authorized branded re-manufactured
replacement parts. These parts meet or
exceed our specifications. Parts installed
at your dealership carry a nationwide
24-month or unlimited mile (kilometer)
parts and labor limited warranty.
If you do not use Ford authorized parts they
may not meet our specifications and
depending on the part, it could affect
emissions compliance.
Convenience
Many dealerships have extended evening
and Saturday hours to make your service
visit more convenient and they offer one
stop shopping. They can perform any
services that are required on your vehicle,
from general maintenance to collision
repairs.
Note: Not all dealers have extended hours
or body shops. Please contact your dealer
for details.
Protecting Your Investment
Maintenance is an investment that pays
dividends in the form of improved
reliability, durability and resale value. To
maintain the proper performance of your
vehicle and its emission control systems,
make sure you have scheduled
maintenance performed at the designated
intervals.
Your vehicle is equipped with an
information display which displays a
message at the proper oil change service
interval; the interval is one year or 10000
miles (16000 kilometers) under normal
driving conditions.
373
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Scheduled Maintenance
If ENGINE OIL CHANGE DUE NEXT
SERVICE or OIL CHANGE REQUIRED
appears in the information display, it is
time for an oil change; the oil change must
be done within two weeks or 500 miles
(800 kilometers) of the ENGINE OIL
CHANGE DUE NEXT SERVICE or OIL
CHANGE REQUIRED message appearing.
The oil minder system must be reset after
each oil change.  See Oil Change
Indicator Reset (page 216).
If your information display resets
prematurely or becomes inoperative, you
should perform the oil change interval at
six months or 5000 miles (8000
kilometers) from your last oil change.
Never exceed one year or 10000 miles
(16000 kilometers) between oil change
intervals.
Your vehicle is very sophisticated and built
with multiple, complex, performance
systems. Every manufacturer develops
these systems using different
specifications and performance features.
That is why it is important to rely upon your
dealership to properly diagnose and repair
your vehicle.
Ford Motor Company has recommended
maintenance intervals for various parts
and component systems based upon
engineering testing. Ford Motor Company
relies upon this testing to determine the
most appropriate mileage for replacement
of oils and fluids to protect your vehicle at
the lowest overall cost to you and
recommends against maintenance
schedules that deviate from the scheduled
maintenance information.
We strongly recommend the use of only
genuine Ford, Motorcraft or
Ford-authorized re-manufactured
replacement parts engineered for your
vehicle.
Additives and Chemicals
This owner's manual and the Ford
Workshop Manual list the recommended
additives and chemicals for your vehicle.
We do not recommend using chemicals or
additives not approved by us as part of
your vehicle’s normal maintenance. Please
consult your warranty information.
Oils, Fluids and Flushing
In many cases, fluid discoloration is a
normal operating characteristic and, by
itself, does not necessarily indicate a
concern or that the fluid needs to be
changed. However, a qualified expert, such
as the factory-trained technicians at your
dealership, should inspect discolored fluids
that also show signs of overheating or
foreign material contamination
immediately.
Make sure to change your vehicle’s oils and
fluids at the specified intervals or in
conjunction with a repair. Flushing is a
viable way to change fluid for many vehicle
sub-systems during scheduled
maintenance. It is critical that systems are
flushed only with new fluid that is the same
as that required to fill and operate the
system or using a Ford-approved flushing
chemical.
Owner Checks and Services
Make sure you perform the following basic
maintenance checks and inspections every
month or at six-month intervals.
374

Multi-Point Inspection
In order to keep your vehicle running right,
it is important to have the systems on your
vehicle checked regularly. This can help
identify potential issues and prevent major
problems. We recommend having the
following multi-point inspection performed
at every scheduled maintenance interval
to help make sure your vehicle keeps
running great.

vehicle inspection. It is a comprehensive
way to perform a thorough inspection of
your vehicle. Your checklist gives you
immediate feedback on the overall
condition of your vehicle.
NORMAL SCHEDULED
MAINTENANCE
Intelligent Oil-Life Monitor™
Your vehicle is equipped with an Intelligent
Oil-Life Monitor that determines when you
should change the engine oil based on how
your vehicle is used. By using several
important factors in its calculations, the
monitor helps reduce the cost of owning
your vehicle and reduces environmental
waste at the same time.
This means you do not have to remember
to change the oil on a mileage-based
schedule. Your vehicle lets you know when
an oil change is due by displaying a
message in the information display.

SYNC® Automotive Important Safety
Information Read and follow
instructions:
•
Before using your SYNC® system, read
and follow all instructions and safety
information provided in this end user
manual ("Owner Guide".) Not
following precautions found in the
Owner Guide can lead to an accident
or other serious injuries.
General Operation
•
Voice Command Control: Certain
functions within the SYNC® system
may be accomplished using voice
commands. Using voice commands
while driving helps you to operate the
system without removing your hands
from the wheel or eyes from the road.
•
Prolonged Views of Screen:  Do not
access any function requiring a
prolonged view of the screen while you
are driving. Pull over in a safe and legal
manner before attempting to access a
function of the system requiring
prolonged attention.
•
Volume Setting: Do not raise the
volume excessively. Keep the volume
at a level where you can still hear
outside traffic and emergency signals
while driving. Driving while unable to
hear these sounds could cause an
accident.
•
Navigation Features: Any navigation
features included in the system are
intended to provide turn by turn
instructions to get you to a desired
destination. Please make certain all
persons using this system carefully
read and follow instructions and safety
information fully.
•
Distraction Hazard: Any navigation
features may require manual
(non-verbal) setup. Attempting to
perform such set-up or insert data
while driving can distract your attention
and could cause an accident or other
serious injury. Stop the vehicle in a safe
and legal manner before attempting
these operations.
•
Let Your Judgment Prevail: Any
navigation features are provided only
as an aid. Make your driving decisions
based on your observations of local
conditions and existing traffic
regulations. Any such feature is not a
395
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Appendices
substitute for your personal judgment.
Any route suggestions made by this
system should never replace any local
traffic regulations or your personal
judgment or knowledge of safe driving
practices.
•
Route Safety: Do not follow the route
suggestions if doing so would result in
an unsafe or illegal maneuver, if you
would be placed in an unsafe situation,
or if you would be directed into an area
that you consider unsafe. The driver is
ultimately responsible for the safe
operation of the vehicle and therefore,
must evaluate whether it is safe to
follow the suggested directions.
•
Potential Map Inaccuracy:  Maps
used by this system may be inaccurate
because of changes in roads, traffic
controls or driving conditions. Always
use good judgment and common sense
when following the suggested routes.
•
Emergency Services: Do not rely on
any navigation features included in the
system to route you to emergency
services. Ask local authorities or an
emergency services operator for these
locations. Not all emergency services
such as police, fire stations, hospitals
and clinics are likely to be contained in
the map database for such navigation
features.
Your Responsibilities and Assumptions of

Binding Arbitration and Class Action
Waiver
(a) Application.  This Section applies to
any dispute EXCEPT IT DOES NOT
INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, OR TO THE
ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR,
FORD MOTOR COMPANY, OR ANY OF
FORD MOTOR COMPANY’S LICENSORS’
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
Dispute means any dispute, action, or other
controversy between You and FORD
MOTOR COMPANY, other than the
exceptions listed above, concerning the
SOFTWARE (including its price) or this
EULA, whether in contract, warranty, tort,
statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other
legal or equitable basis.
(b) Notice of Dispute.  In the event of a
Dispute, You or FORD MOTOR COMPANY
must give the other a “Notice of Dispute”,
which is a written statement of the name,
address, and contact information of the
party giving it, the facts giving rise to the
dispute, and the relief requested. You and
FORD MOTOR COMPANY will attempt to
resolve any dispute through informal
negotiation within 60 days from the date
the Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days,
You or FORD MOTOR COMPANY may
commence arbitration.
(c) Small claims court. You may also
litigate any dispute in small claims court
in your county of residence or FORD
MOTOR COMPANY’S principal place of
business, if the dispute meets all
requirements to be heard in the small
claims court. You may litigate in small
claims court whether or not You
negotiated informally first.
(d) Binding arbitration. If You and FORD
MOTOR COMPANY, do not resolve any
dispute by informal negotiation or in small
claims court, any other effort to resolve
the dispute will be conducted exclusively
by binding arbitration. You are giving up
the right to litigate (or participate in as a
party or class member) all disputes in court
before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes
will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator,
whose decision will be final except for a
limited right of appeal under the Federal
Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction
over the parties may enforce the
arbitrator’s award.
(e) Class action waiver. Any proceedings
to resolve or litigate any dispute in any
forum will be conducted solely on an
individual basis. Neither you nor FORD
MOTOR COMPANY, will seek to have any
dispute heard as a class action, as a private
attorney general action, or in any other
proceeding in which any party acts or
proposes to act in a representative
capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will
be combined with another without the
prior written consent of all parties to all
affected arbitrations or proceedings.
(f) Arbitration procedure.  Any
arbitration will be conducted by the
American Arbitration Association (the
“AAA”), under its Commercial Arbitration
Rules. If You are an individual and use the
SOFTWARE for personal or vehicle use, or
if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or
less whether or not You are an individual
or how You use the SOFTWARE, the AAA
Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer-Related Disputes will also
apply. To commence arbitration, submit a
Commercial Arbitration Rules Demand for
Arbitration form to the AAA. You may
request a telephonic or in-person hearing
by following the AAA rules. In a dispute
involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will
be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds
good cause to hold an in-person hearing
instead. For more information, see adr.org
or call 1-800-778-7879. You agree to
commence arbitration only in your county
of residence or FORD MOTOR COMPANY’S
principal place of business. The arbitrator
398
EcoSport (CBW) Canada/United States of America, Vehicles Built From: 17-06-2019, LN1J-19A321-ZFA enUSA, Edition date: 201904, First-Printing
Appendices
may award the same damages to You
individually as a court could. The arbitrator
may award declaratory or injunctive relief
only to You individually, and only to the
extent required to satisfy Your individual
claim.
(g) Arbitration fees and incentives.
•
I. Disputes involving $75,000 or less.
FORD MOTOR COMPANY will
promptly reimburse your filing fees and
pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and
expenses. If you reject FORD MOTOR
COMPANY’S last written settlement
offer made before the arbitrator was
appointed (“last written offer”), your
dispute goes all the way to an
arbitrator’s decision (called an
“award”), and the arbitrator awards
you more than the last written offer,
FORD MOTOR COMPANY will give you
three incentives: (1) pay the greater of
the award or $1,000; (2) pay twice your
reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and
(3) reimburse any expenses (including
expert witness fees and costs) that
your attorney reasonably accrues for
investigating, preparing, and pursuing
your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator
will determine the amounts.
•
ii. Disputes involving more than
$75,000. The AAA rules will govern
payment of filing fees and the AAA’s
and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
•
iii. Disputes involving any amount. In
any arbitration you commence, FORD
MOTOR COMPANY will seek its AAA
or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or
Your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the
arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous
or brought for an improper purpose. In
any arbitration FORD MOTOR
COMPANY commences, it will pay all
filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and
expenses. It will not seek its attorney’s
fees or expenses from you in any
arbitration. Fees and expenses are not
counted in determining how much a
dispute involves.
(h) Claims or disputes must be filed
within one year.  To the extent permitted
by law, any claim or dispute under this
EULA to which this Section applies must
be filed within one year in small claims
court (Section c) or in arbitration (Section
d). The one-year period begins when the
claim or dispute first could be filed. If such
a claim or dispute is not filed within one
year, it is permanently barred.
(I) Severability. If the class action waiver
(Section e) is found to be illegal or
unenforceable as to all or some parts of a
dispute, then that portion of Section e will
not apply to those parts. Instead, those
parts will be severed and proceed in a court
of law, with the remaining parts proceeding
in arbitration. If any other provision of that
portion Section e is found to be illegal or
unenforceable, that provision will be
severed with the remainder of Section e
remaining in full force and effect.

Note: In accordance with the management
approach of low-power radio wave
radiation motors:
Article 12: For approved and certified
low-power radiation motor models,
companies, firms or users must not alter
the frequency, increase the power or
change the characteristics and functions
of the original design without authorization.
Article 14: The usage of low-power
radio-frequency motors must not affect
aviation safety and interfere with legal
telecommunications. Should interference
be detected, immediately stop using the
device and only resume usage after
ensuring that there is no longer any
interference. For the legal
telecommunication and wireless
telecommunication of the telco, the
low-power radio frequency motor must be
able to tolerate legal limits of interference
from telecommunication, industrial,
scientific and radio wave equipment.
